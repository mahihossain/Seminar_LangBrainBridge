out
with
somebody
you
like

all
sitting
at

table
trying
to
be

i
usually
end
up
just
sitting
there
staring
at
like

i
never
brought
anybody
home
you
know
a

was
thirty
years
old
i
had
never
brought
anybody

even
like
back
in
like
first
grade
like
second
grade
i
mean
i
had
friends
and
shit
i
just
never
brought
them
home
so
i
started
thinking
like
you
know
how
the
hell
did
that
start
you
know
it's
you
know
so
we're
basically
driving
up
from
new
york
to
go
to
my
house
to
finally
uh
meet
my
parents
and
uh
i
remember
like
i
think
it
was
like
when
i
was
in
first
grade
we
used
to
have
a
bus
stop
and
it
was
like
right
out
in
front
of
my
house
and
my
parents
used
to
always
be
arguing
and
my
dad
was
like
a
maniac
you
know
always
screaming
goddamn
fucking
bitch
you
know
just
total
psycho
my
dad
was
a
complete
psychopath
you
know
like
his
nickname
in
in
my
house
was
called
the
thing
cause
that's
what
he
was
he
was
like
he
was
this
fucking
thing
that
like
if
he
wasn't
around
we
say
dude
is
the
thing
home
you
know
if
he
wasn't
home
we
could
chill
he
was
just
like
never
in
a
good
mood
so
one
day
i'm
down
at
the
bus
stop
there's
like
you
know
ten
other
kids
down
there
and
shit
we
were
all
in
like
first
grade
second
grade
third
grade
waiting
for
the
bus
and
it's
like
towards
the
summer
time
so
my
parents
got
like
the
windows
open
and
shit
so
i
can
start
to
hear
like
an
argument
starting
like
oh
what
the
fuck
do
you
mean
you
didn't
ahwahah
and
i'm
sitting
there
i'm
sitting
there
going
please
please
let
the
bus
come
please
for
christ's
sake
all
a
sudden
you
goddamn
fucking
bitch
ahahah
screaming
and
shit
and
i
remember
just
looking
at
all
the
other
kids'
looks
on
their
faces
like
i
guess
you
know
this
is
like
way
before
cable
so
most
kids
never
even
heard
curses
they
couldn't
believe
it
and
i
was
just
that's
when
it
really
hit
me
that
man
my
family
is
really
screwed
up
and
i
started
going
to
other
kids'
houses
and
their
parents
seemed
to
get
along
and
they
were
like
cool
and
uh
so
the
whole
time
i'm
driving
back
with
my
girlfriend
coming
up
all
this
stuff
is
like
coming
back
and
i'm
thinking
and
all
like
i'm
a
six
year
old
kid
again
like
getting
all
nervous
like
how
my
dad's
gonna
like
act
because
it's
like
embarrassing
you
know
i
mean
{cg}
i
don't
know
like
like
he
was
one
of
these
dudes
where
like
uh
i
don't
know
he
was
always
in
a
bad
mood
like
if
he
tried
to
like
teach
you
something
he'd
say
it
once
and
then
when
you
didn't
get
it
he'd
just
say
it
louder
and
louder
and
i
remember
was
six
and
i
was
going
this
guy
is
retarded
like
i
remember
we
got
a
dog
and
he
tried
to
teach
this
dog
how
to
sit
alright
it's
a
dog
it
doesn't
speak
english
and
he's
sitting
there
going
like
sit
this
little
puppy
sit
sit
down
you're
gonna
get
over
there
and
you're
gonna
sit
down
dog's
sitting
there
like
walking
around
like
peeing
like
wha
what
the
fuck
is
wrong
with
this
guy
that
was
like
his
thing
man
everything
like
at
my
house
my
parents
they
were
like
ridiculously
strict
we
had
all
these
stupid
rules
like
i
remember
they
had
like
like
this
one
rule
whatever
you
didn't
eat
for
dinner
they
would

just
like
wrap
it
in
cellophane
and
you
had
to
like
eat
it
the
next
morning
for
breakfast
and
its
like
everybody
sitting
eating
like
pancakes
and
waffles
you're
like
eating
like
cube
steaks
and
shit
you
be
dad
would
be
going
come
on
eat
it
i
don't
want
to
eat
it
eat
it
so
i'm
like
driving
back
and
that's
all
i'm
thinking
like
this
guy's
just
gonna
completely
embarrass
me
and
uh
i
don't
know
like
it's
just
i
just
felt
weird
like

like
the
you
know
how
most
families
are
like
loving
and
like
build
somebody
up
like
our
family
was
just
like
ripping
somebody
down
like
uh
i
think
the
worst
think
he
ever
did
to
me
this
is
the
one
that
really
kinda
made
me
like
the
anxious
like
worrisome
person
that
i
am
waha
uh
was
right
around
christmas
and
i
was
already
thinking
this
cause
i
was
driving
this
girl
up
for
christmas
he
uh
he
was
giving
me
shit
one
day
he
always
hated
when
i
was
joking
around
i
think
making
my
mother
laugh
somehow

i
don't

bug
him
or

kept
giving
me
shit
come

joking
around
you

giggling
all
the
time
you're
acting
like
a
little
girl
and
i'm
thinking
like
cause
he's
always
fucking
with
me
like
oh

has
a
new
angle
you

christmas
you
act
like
a
little
girl
what
the
fuck's
wrong
with
you
and
i'm
just
sitting
there
going
ah

like
two
weeks
later
it's
christmastime
i
got
like
four
brothers
right
and
we
always
sneak
down
to
go
look
at
the
presents
so
we
go
downstairs
right
there's
all
these
gifts
down
there
all
wrapped
and
we're
all
looking
to
see
who
got
what
you
know
and
there's
all
these
little
tags
to
ed
from
santa
you
know
be
like
to
bob
from
mom
and
dad
or
whatever
and
i'm
sitting
there
pause
just
wait
a
sec
pause
so
i
look
and
in
like
the
middle
of
the
tree
i
see
there's
a
doll
and
i'm
thinking
i've
got
four
brothers
why
the
fuck
is
there
a
doll
sitting
here
i
don't
know
i'm
just
looking
at
this
thing
you
ever
seen
like
those
spike
lee
movies
where
like
the
background
moves
and
the
character
doesn't
it's
like
one
of
those
deals
and
i
look
up
at
this
doll
right
and
it
says
to
bill
from
santa
and
i'm
like
what
the
fuck
guy
got
me
a
goddamn
doll
he
came
downstairs
and
he's
laughing
and
shit
and
he's
making
me
take
a
picture
i'm
like
six
years
old
and
crying
and
stuff
and
uh
and
and
i'm
thinking
of
this
shit
as
i'm
pulling
into
the
driveway
i'm
like
freaking
out
cause
i'm
finally
gonna
bring
somebody
home
to
meet
this
fucking
maniac
and
uh
and
i'm
telling
her
i
don't
know
how
this
guy's
gonna
be
or
whatever
so
we
walk
into
the
house
and
it's
like
uh
candles
and
shit
christmas
tree
it's
all
real
nice
dim
lights
and
stuff
she
comes
in
she
meets
my
dad
and
the
dude
is
like
totally
normal
after
me
building
this
guy
up
the
whole
ride
back
he's
like
fucking
like
you
know
that
dude
from
leave
it
to
beaver
he's
like
the
nicest
guy
ever
he's
all
cordial
and
i
remember
i'm
just
getting
like
pissed
at
the
guy
like
why
isn't
he
being
a
dick
and
she's
sitting
there
taking
me
aside
going
he's
the
greatest
guy
i
can't
believe
you're
saying
all
that
stuff
he's
such
you
know
he's
smart
intelligent
he's
so
interested
in
what
i
have
to
say
i
remember
was
like
i
was
so
pissed
at
the
guy
i
mean
i
really
hated
him
when
i
was
growing
up
to
the
point
i
remember
one
time
he
went
out
in
the
driveway
and
he
was
running
out
to
his
car
and
he
slipped
and
fell
and
broke
his
shoulder
and
at
that
point
me
and
my
brothers
so
fucking
hated
this
guy
when
he
came
into
the
house
my
mother's
like
taking
care
of
him
we
snuck
out
the
back
door
to
look
at
his
footprints
in
the
snow
to
see
where
he
slipped
and
fell
and
i'm
telling
you
we
were
laughing
our
asses
off
at
this
guy
like
right
there
right
there
that's
wha
fuck
why
couldn't
i
have
seen
that
so
uh
so
he
ended
up
being
like
the
sweetest
guy
ever
and
there
was
nothing
anxious
about
it
i
was
like
worried
about
for
like
i
don't
know
from
the
beginning
of
the
time
dating
girls
like
from
fifteen
and
i
just
ended
up
feeling
really
stupid
and
uh
i
was
kinda
pissed
i
was
looking
at
the
guy
going
like
why
the
fuck
couldn't
you
have
been
like
this
you
know
twenty
years
ago
when
i
needed
him
to
be
like
that
rather
than
you
know
being
the
way
he
was
and
uh
that's
my
story
thanks
