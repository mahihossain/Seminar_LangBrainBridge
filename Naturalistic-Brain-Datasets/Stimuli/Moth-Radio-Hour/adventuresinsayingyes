
i
first
started
taking
care
of
other
people's
children
when
i
was
actually
still
just
a
child
myself
so
that
meant
people
were
paying
me
basically
to
play
and
that
was
really
awesome
but
it
also
meant
that
i
was
getting
a
ton
of
childcare
experience
and
that
by
the
time
i
was
sixteen
i
probably
could
make
macaroni
and
cheese
with
my
eyes
shut
or
change
a
diaper
with
one
hand
tied
behind
my
back
which
i
only
probably
ever
would
have
to
do
with
those
very
naughty
nicholson
boys
but
uh
their
mother
knew
they
were
a
handful
she
was
paying
ten
dollars
an
hour
in
nineteen
eighty
eight
so
i
kind
of
thought
that
all
of
my
childcare
experience
was
gonna
teach
me
everything
that
i
needed
to
know
about
parenting
my
own
children
and
my
husband
and
i
we
had
a
daughter
and
then
a
son
and
then
we
decided
to
become
foster
parents
uh
with
the
intention
of
hopefully
being
able
to
adopt
one
day
and
you
know
how
everybody
always
says
you
need
a
license
to
drive
a
car
but
you
don't
need
one
to
have
a
child
that's
not
true
when
you
become
a
foster
parent
we
did
have
to
get
a
license
and
so
first
we
had
to
take
these
classes
where
they
asked
us
really
hard
hitting
questions
like
is
secondhand
smoke
good
or
bad
and
um
do
babies
actually
need
car
seats
and
then
we
had
to
do
uh
all
sorts
of
other
things
um
have
physicals
done
background
checks
fingerprinted
have
our
home
inspected
interviews
i
mean
the
whole
thing
turned
out
to
be
way
more
complicated
than
just
creating
a
new
human
being
with
my
body
and
then
there
were
all
the
questions
what
kind
of
child
would
we
be
willing
to
take
a
girl
or
a
boy
what
race
what
age
now
i
grew
up
with
three
sisters
and
i
already
had
one
boy
that
i
didn't
always
know
how
to
relate
to
but
then
i
heard
that
boys
are
actually
left
behind
more
in
adoption
requests
so
we
said
that
we
preferred
a
boy
any
race
and
having
survived
two
infants
already
we
thought
that
that
pleasure
could
be
afforded
to
someone
else
so
anything
up
to
age
four
the
age
of
our
biological
son
at
the
time
and
we
got
our
license
in
the
mail
and
we
settled
in
for
what
we
thought
could
be
a
very
long
wait
but
we
got
a
phone
call
six
weeks
later
about
a
baby
at
the
hospital
and
i
thought
wow
an
infant
doesn't
everybody
else
want
an
infant
but
we
said
yes
and
when
we
went
to
the
hospital
to
pick
him
up
the
nurses
insisted
on
pushing
me
out
to
the
car
in
a
wheelchair
which
i
thought
was
very
funny

i
mean
i
didn't
suffer
any
physical
distress
bringing
this
kid
into
the
world
and
even
though
i
thought
it
was
really
funny
though
i
realized
i
was
having
the
same
exact
overwhelmingly
surreal
sensation
that
i
had
when
i
first
left
the
hospital
with
my
first
two
babies
and
that
was
there's
a
new
person
here
there's
this
new
human
being
that's
so
tiny
and
perfect
and
amazing
and
this
hospital
staff
is
gonna
let
us
just
leave
with
him
even
though
they
look
really
confident
and
we
got
him
home
and
it
became
obvious
right
away
that
there
were
things
that
we
still
needed
to
learn
in
spite
of
years
of
babysitting
and
parenting
experience
and
having
a
license
to
parent
like
what
to
do
when
a
young
woman
comes
bouncing
up
to
you
and
says
your
baby
is
so
cute
is
his
daddy
black
so
i
just
uh
pretended
i
couldn't
really
remember
or
what
to
do
when
a
woman
taps
you
on
the
shoulder
at
a
crowded
restaurant
and
demands
to
know
where's
that
baby
from
and
when
told
new
jersey
uh
just
continues
to
keep
asking
but
where
before
that
but
where
before
that
until
you're
finally
just
forced
to
say
a
uterus
or
what
to
do
when
your
four
year
old
white
son
comes
running
up
and
says
we're
playing
circus
and
the
baby
has
to
be
the
monkey
because
he's
brown
and
your
african
american
case
worker
is
visiting
and
all
you
can
think
to
do
is
that
you
just
wanna
die
on
the
spot
and
so
instead
you
just
pretend
you
didn't
hear
him
and
make
a
strong
mental
note
to
talk
to
him
about
that
later
i
don't
think
they
told
us
anything
about
transracial
adoption
in
those
classes
uh
the
most
they
might
have
said
was
something
along
the
lines
of
if
you
are
white
and
have
a
black
child
placed
with
you
please
for
the
love
of
god
get
some
help
with
their
skin
and
hair
and
so
i
turned
to
my
black
friends
and
and
i
asked
for
help
and
they
helped
me
and
they
also
taught
me
things
like
that
my
little
black
boy
was
only
gonna
be
cute
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
for
a
certain
age
and
then
he
would
um
somehow
over
night
be
perceived
as
threatening
to
the
public
and
that
it
was
gonna
happen
much
sooner
than
i
would
anticipate
and
i
listened
to
them
and
i
learned
from
them
but
i
didn't
experience
any
of
that
harsh
reality
yet
and
our
case
moved
along
and
we
were
given
the
go
ahead
to
adopt
him
and
i
got
some
paperwork
in
the
mail
it
was
an
adoption
subsidy
agreement
and
next
to
the
name
of
our
adorable
funny
very
loved
and
very
wanted
son
was
the
reason
for
the
monthly
subsidy
that
he
was
gonna
get
ah
and
it
was
checked
off
child
is
hard
to
place
african
american
and
i
felt
like
i
had
been
punched
in
the
stomach
and
then
one
day
we
get
a
phone
call
from
our
case
worker
and
i
wasn't
expecting
it
and
i
could
tell
something
was
up
and
i
was
right
because
she
said
do
you
have
room
for
another
baby
and
we
weren't
really
planning
on
having
any
more
children
but
um
we
loved
our
little
son
so
much
we
loved
any
sibling
of
his
and
so
i
said
what
is
it
and
she
said
a
boy
and
so
i
cried
a
little
when
i
said
okay
and
then
i
said
i
guess
i
better
call
my
husband
and
ask
him
real
quick
though
so
then
we
were
up
to
four
children
one
girl
and
three
boys
and
i
was
pretty
sure
that
i
was
done
with
babies
but
then
i
went
to
a
baby
shower
and
all
the
the
new
mom
was
opening
up
all
these
tiny
little
socks
and
really
cute
onesies
and
things
and
all
the
women
were
just
gushing
and
i
realize
that
i
was
sitting
like
a
little
bit
away
from
the
rest
of
them
and
just
thinking
that
looks
like
more
laundry
to
me
so
then
i
really
knew
that
i
was
done
with
babies
until
i
got
a
phone
call
about
our
boy's
baby
sister
and
could
we
come
get
her
like
today
did
we
have
a
car
seat
and
so
even
though
we
knew
it
meant
getting
on
another
two
year
emotional
roller
coaster
we
borrowed
a
car
seat
and
said
yes
six
years
after
starting
our
fostering
experience
we
had
adopted
each
of
our
children
we
got
to
say
goodbye
to
the
judges
and
the
case
workers
and
good
riddance
to
the
one
that
we
referred
to
as
the
anti
social
worker
and
hello
to
the
architect
and
contractors
lessons
were
still
being
learned
and
mistakes
were
being
made
i
can
admit
that
i
have
been
that
white
mom
out
at
the
store
when
a
black
woman
told
me
that
my
baby's
hair
felt
a
little
bit
dry
and
i
knew
i
i
had
to
learn
from
all
these
different
sources
the
the
black
community
adult
adopteest
more
experienced
transracially
adoptive
families
and
all
while
trying
to
balance
it
with
what
it
meant
to
be
our
family
in
this
time
and
in
this
place
and
i
thought
we
were
doing
alright
and
then
one
day
my
son
was
getting
ready
for
school
he
was
six
years
old
and
uh
getting
ready
for
first
grade
and
he
was
brushing
his
teeth
and
he
just
stopped
and
he
said
i
wish
a
brown
family
adopted
me
he
he
wasn't
upset
he
was
very
matter
of
fact
like
i
wanna
wear
my
blue
sneakers
and
i
wish
a
brown
family
adopted
me
but
i
was
stunned
i
knew
he
might
say
something
like
that
at
some
point
but
i
just
wasn't
really
expecting
it
and
so
i
uh
just
tried
to
stay
calm
and
i
said
oh
well
how
come
and
he
said
i
want
the
family
to
look
like
me
and
so
i
pointed
out
that
his
younger
brother
and
sister
looked
like
him
and
he
said
yeah
but
not
the
whole
family
and
so
i
just
apologized
i
didn't
know
what
else
i
could
possibly
do
and
i
got
him
off
to
school
and
the
whole
day
i
was
thinking
you
know
what
am
i
gonna
do
about
this
and
on
one
hand
i
didn't
wanna
do
anything
i
mean
the
kid
seems
fine
i
don't
wanna
bother
him
you
know
get
him
upset
about
it
but
on
the
other
hand
you
know
you
have
to
muddle
things
up
sometimes
before
you
get
some
clarity
so
at
bedtime
that
night
i
muddled
things
up
and
i
asked
him
are
you
still
feeling
sad
that
a
brown
family
didn't
adopt
you
and
he
didn't
say
anything
he
just
nodded
yes
so
i
said
um
did
anybody
do
anything
or
say
something
recently
that
made
you
start
to
feel
that
way
and
again
he
just
nodded
no
so
now
i'm
grasping
for
straws
um
did
you
know
that
daddy
and
i
love
you
very
very
very
very
very
much
and
again
just
a
nod
yes
i
mean
clearly
the
kid
was
not
gonna
help
me
move
the
conversation
forward
at
all
and
so
i
i
had
no
idea
what
to
say
and
so
i
absolutely
surprised
myself
with
what
came
out
next
and
i
said
to
him
did
you
know
that
there's
sadness
to
adoption
and
this
time
his
interest
was
piqued
because
this
time
he
spoke
and
he
said
no
i
didn't
and
i
said
well
yeah
most
of
the
time
everybody
only
talks
about
how
really
happy
adoption
is
and
we
are
so
so
happy
that
you're
part
of
our
family
but
if
the
world
was
perfect
and
there
were
never
any
problems
at
all
you
probably
could
have
just
stayed
with
your
first
mommy
don't
you
think
and
this
time
my
boy
answered
me
it
wasn't
with
a
nod
or
with
words
but
he
sobbed
it
wasn't
crying
over
a
skinned
knee
he
was
sobbing
over
an
emotional
wound
that
he
didn't
know
he
had
and
he
still
lacked
the
emotional
maturity
and
the
language
to
really
explore
it
but
there
was
something
about
my
acknowledging
it
for
him
that
just
unlocked
the
deepest
sob
i'd
ever
heard
come
out
of
a
little
child
and
i
told
him
it
was
okay
to
be
sad
about
that
and
maybe
even
forever
but
that
i
wanted
to
help
him
find
peace
over
it
and
would
he
maybe
like
to
try
to
meet
some
more
of
his
birth
family
and
he
said
yes
so
i
reached
out
to
our
last
case
worker
and
i
i
said
i'd
heard
about
this
great
grandma
can
you
give
me
her
number
or
something
and
he
said
no
um
i'm
actually
not
allowed
to
give
that
out
so
i
did
a
little
more
asking
around
and
some
research
and
i
found
out
that
he
could
however
send
a
letter
on
my
behalf
now
based
on
my
history
with
the
state
i
didn't
really
trust
that
this
was
gonna
happen
but
i
had
to
take
a
chance
i
wrote
the
letter
and
i
sent
it
and
hoped
for
the
best
and
uh
it
worked
because
she
called
us
a
week
or
two
later
this
great
grandmother
who
had
worried
about
them
and
prayed
for
them
for
years
and
we
went
to
go
meet
her
immediately
and
as
soon
as
we
did
all
these
doors
kept
opening
because
every
time
we
went
we
just
would
meet
a
new
family
member
and
each
one
of
them
welcomed
all
of
us
our
adopted
kids
our
biological
kids
my
husband
and
myself
with
open
arms
and
all
these
relationships
that
could
have
felt
awkward
or
strained
just
never
did
and
our
children
thrived
because
of
it
and
that
was
four
years
ago
and
on
a
more
recent
visit
i
was
sitting
ca
catching
up
with
the
kids'
auntie
like
on
a
couch
over
here
and
i
could
see
my
husband
eating
and
talking
with
another
family
member
over
there
and
some
of
my
kids
were
doing
crafts
with
some
cousins
and
others
were
running
around
playing
ninja
turtles
with
other
cousins
and
there
was
popop
sitting
on
the
couch
and
he
had
the
tv
on
the
nature
channel
way
too
loud
like
he
always
has
it
and
i
know
that
now
and
there
was
my
son
just
snuggled
up
by
his
side
and
trading
wild
animal
facts
with
his
grandfather
and
looking
around
the
room
that
day
i
thought
to
myself
you
know
growing
up
i
always
thought
that
adoption
just
meant
uh
a
new
family
for
the
children
that
are
adopted
but
looking
around
here
i
know
that
in
our
case
it
means
so
much
more
because
it
uh
it's
a
family
for
all
of
us
