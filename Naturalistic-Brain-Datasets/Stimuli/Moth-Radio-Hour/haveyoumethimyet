
in
two
thousand
eight
i
was
one
of
those
young
people
who
became
obsessed
with
barack
obama
i
i
was
a
senior
in
college
at
the
time
and
after
i
graduated
i
drove
out
to
ohio
and
i
worked
on
his
campaign
and
after
the
campaign
i
drove
to
washington
because
hope
in
change
and
two
years
later
the
white
house
actually
hired
me
they
hired
me
to
write
speeches
and
people
would
hear
about
my
new
job
and
they
would
say
wow
you
must
be
really
good
and
i
would
say
i
dunno
i
hope
so
and
they
thought
i
was
pretending
to
be
humble
but
i
was
entirely
sincere
eh
it's
not
that
i
didn't
think
i
had
any
talent
whatsoever
i
it's
just
that
i
knew
there
are
three
hundred
million
people
in
america
a
and
some
of
them
are
babies
but
a
lot
of
them
are
adults
a
and
it
just
seemed
unlikely
that
i
was
the
best
we
the
people
could
do
so
every
day
i
walked
through
the
gates
of
the
white
house
absolutely
sure
somebody
had
made
a
mistake
and
while
this
was
going
on
my
friends
and
family
were
equally
sure
they
now
had
direct
access
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
like
i
i'm
sitting
in
my
white
house
office
and
i
get
a
text
from
my
sister
rebecca
and
it
says
how
come
the
department
of
homeland
security
doesn't
have
a
mailing
address
now
even
in
the
best
of
circumstances
this
is
a
disturbing
question
to
get
from
a
family
member
but
if
you
work
in
the
white
house
you
wanna
know
the
answer
to
this
kind
of
stuff
and
i
have
no
idea
and
it's
like
this
with
everything
i
mean
suddenly
everyone
has
a
law
that
only
i
can
get
through
congress
everybody
everybody
has
a
a
a
something
wrong
with
obamacare
that
i
need
to
know
about
mostly
everybody
has
the
same
question
they
all
wanna
know
have
you
met
him
yet
have
you
met
obama
yet
and
i
say
no
i
haven't
met
him
yet
and
i
get
this
look
and
it's
a
look
i
soon
learn
means
you
may
be
twenty
four
years
old
and
working
at
the
white
house
but
you're
still
a
disappointment
to
your
family
and
friends
and
i
have
to
say
i
totally
get
it
i
mean
everybody
thinks
that
the
white
house
is
either
like
the
tv
show
the
west
wing
where
everyone's
hanging
out
with
the
president
or
it's
like
the
tv
show
scandal
where
everyone's
having
sex
with
the
president
but
if
you're
looking
for
for
a
hollywood
analogy
the
white
house
is
like
the
death
star
um
what
i
mean
by
that
is
just
that
there's
thousands
of
people
that
that
run
around
the
hallways
they're
all
just
trying
to
make
sure
their
little
bit
of
their
job
works
well
and
just
because
darth
vader
is
the
public
face
of
the
organization
it
doesn't
mean
that
every
storm
trooper
gets
personal
one
on
one
time
so
i
try
to
explain
this
whole
death
star
thing
and
it
doesn't
work
i
still
get
that
disappointed
look
and
frankly
nobody's
more
disappointed
than
i
am
i
i
mean
nobody
wants
me
to
meet
the
president
more
than
me
and
there's
two
reasons
for
this
the
first
i
is
kind
of
corny
but
it's
true
i
moved
to
washington
because
i
thought
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
there
must
be
something
i
can
do
for
my
country
i
i
wanna
be
the
kind
of
person
where
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
just
a
little
bit
better
at
his
job
because
i'm
in
the
room
and
the
second
reason
is
i
would
really
like
barack
obama
and
i
to
become
best
friends
and
now
now
i'm
not
saying
that
every
white
house
staffer
imagined
that
they
would
become
buddies
with
the
president
i
i'm
just
saying
that
none
of
us
ruled
it
out
like
you
would
hear
these
stories
you
know
somebody
got
a
a
fist
bump
in
the
hallway
or
someone
else
got
invited
up
to
play
cards
on
air
force
one
a
and
the
moral
was
always
the
same
any
moment
could
be
the
moment
that
changes
your
life
forever
now
my
first
chance
at
a
life
changing
moment
came
in
november
two
thousand
eleven
when
i
was
asked
to
write
the
thanksgiving
video
address
i
will
say
upfront
if
state
of
the
union
is
all
the
way
on
one
end
of
the
presidential
speech
writing
spectrum
happy
thanksgiving
america
is
kinda
on
the
other
side
but
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
this
was
the
most
important
set
of
words
barack
obama
would
ever
say
a
and
so
i
threw
myself
into
this
i
mean
i
i
wrote
and
i
rewrote
and
i
made
edits
and
then
i
made
edits
to
the
edits
a
and
finally
the
day
of
the
taping
came
and
i
went
to
the
diplomatic
room
which
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
rooms
in
the
white
house
it
has
this
wraparound
mural
of
nineteenth
century
american
life
and
the
advice
i
always
got
was
you
have
to
act
like
you've
been
there
before
so
so
i'm
standing
there
tryinna
act
like
i've
been
there
before
and
the
woman
behind
the
camera
takes
one
look
at
me
and
goes
this
is
your
first
time
here
isn't
it
and
i
crack
immediately
i'm
just
like
yes
i
have
never
been
here
before
please
help
me
and
she
says
don't
worry
she
explains
her
name
is
hope
hall
she
films
the
president
all
the
time
she's
gonna
take
care
of
everything
all
i
have
to
do
is
wait
so
i
wait
and
i
wait
and
i
wait
and
i
wait
a
and
just
when
i'm
wondering
is
this
whole
thing
a
nightmare
is
it
a
practical
joke
somebody
gets
an
email
on
their
blackberry
and
they
say
okay
he's
moving
and
then
there's
kind
of
a
crackling
in
the
air
and
a
minute
later
president
obama
enters
the
room
and
he's
standing
up
so
we
all
stand
up
and
he
sits
down
so
we
all
sit
down
and
he
looks
at
the
camera
to
start
taping
when
hope
stops
him
and
she
says
uh
actually
mr
president
this
is
david
this
is
the
first
video
he's
ever
written
for
you
and
president
obama
looks
at
me
and
he
says
oh
how's
it
going
david
i
had
exactly
one
thought
in
that
moment
i
did
not
realize
we
were
going
to
have
to
answer
questions
and
i
have
literally
no
idea
what
i
said
after
that
i
i
mean
i
actually
blacked
out
like
i
went
home
for
thanksgiving
and
my
family
was
like
so
have
you
met
him
yet
and
i
was
like
yeah
and
they
were
like
what
did
he
say
and
i
was
like
how's
it
going
and
they
were
like
what
did
you
say
and
i
was
like
i
don't
know
i
blacked
out
and
i
get
that
disappointed
look
a
and
i
can't
blame
anybody
because
if
i'm
gonna
be
the
per
kind
of
person
who
makes
the
president
a
little
bit
better
at
his
job
when
i'm
in
the
room
i
am
going
to
have
to
deal
with
questions
more
complicated
than
how's
it
going
and
at
the
moment
there's
no
indication
that
i
can
do
it
but
i
make
a
promise
to
myself
i
i
say
if
i
ever
get
another
shot
at
a
life
changing
moment
i
am
not
gonna
let
myself
down
and
i
didn't
know
if
it
would
ever
happen
for
me
but
in
fact
it
happened
just
a
couple
weeks
later
uh
i
was
sitting
in
my
office
i
got
a
phone
call
from
the
chief
speech
writer
at
the
time
a
guy
named
jon
favreau
and
he
called
me
up
and
he
said
betty
white
is
turning
ninety
years
old
and
nbc
is
doing
this
special
where
different
famous
people
wish
her
a
happy
birthday
in
these
thirty
second
skits
and
you're
pretty
funny
and
no
one
else
wants
to
do
it
wanna
give
it
a
shot
and
i
said
absolutely
and
again
i
understand
state
of
the
union
is
over
here
and
happy
birthday
betty
white
is
over
there
but
this
was
my
gettysburg
address
and
so
we
had
one
week
to
make
it
perfect
we
started
off
jon
and
i
came
up
with
a
joke
for
the
president
we
were
gonna
have
him
fill
out
a
birthday
card
and
then
while
uh
he
was
filling
it
out
you
would
hear
his
voice
on
a
voice
over
say
dear
betty
you're
so
young
and
full
of
life
i
can't
believe
you're
turning
ninety
in
fact
i
don't
believe
it
please
send
a
copy
of
your
long
form
birth
certificate
to
sixteen
hundred
pennsylvania
avenue
washington
dc
so
we
feel
good
about
the
joke
but
but
we
still
need
a
birthday
card
so
uh
one
day
that
week
i
go
to
cvs
near
the
white
house
it's
a
half
block
away
i
grab
a
birthday
card
that
i
think
is
gonna
be
pretty
good
and
then
right
when
i'm
about
to
leave
i
realize
we
don't
actually
need
one
birthday
card
we
need
two
identical
birthday
cards
because
we
have
two
different
camera
angles
we
don't
want
anyone
to
know
that
the
president
has
already
written
his
birthday
greeting
and
i
think
yes
this
is
how
white
house
staffers
are
supposed
to
feel
i
mean
i've
i've
saved
the
day
a
and
so
i
i
walk
back
to
that
to
that
hallmark
rack
and
i
i
get
an
identical
card
and
i
ring
it
up
and
i
go
back
to
my
office
and
i'm
feeling
really
good
a
and
then
the
last
thing
we
need
we
need
some
way
to
end
the
video
and
so
what
i
come
up
with
is
we're
gonna
have
the
president
put
in
headphones
and
then
he'll
listen
to
the
theme
song
from
the
golden
girls
which
is
betty
white's
most
popular
show
so
i
find
the
perfect
pair
of
headphones
that
go
over
the
ear
they'll
look
great
on
camera
a
and
i
listen
to
the
golden
girls
theme
song
on
repeat
just
to
get
in
the
mood
and
then
finally
on
friday
i
get
the
call
come
on
over
now
here's
what
they
don't
tell
you
about
having
a
meeting
in
the
oval
office
when
you
have
a
meeting
in
the
oval
office
you
do
not
just
walk
into
the
oval
office
the
first
thing
you
do
you
wait
in
this
kind
of
windowless
chamber
i
it's
a
little
like
a
doctor's
office
except
instead
of
last
year's
marie
claire
magazine
they
have
priceless
pieces
of
american
art
and
instead
of
a
receptionist
they
have
a
man
with
a
gun
who
in
a
worst
case
scenario
is
legally
obligated
to
kill
you
it
turns
out
this
little
room
is
the
perfect
place
to
second
guess
every
life
choice
you
have
ever
made
a
and
so
i'm
i'm
sitting
there
with
hope
hall
the
videographer
and
i'm
just
thinking
do
i
remember
how
to
explain
the
joke
are
are
both
of
the
birthday
cards
in
there
i
check
my
my
pants
pocket
are
the
headphones
still
there
are
the
headphones
still
there
are
the
headphones
still
there
i
i'm
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
when
finally
one
of
the
president's
aides
pokes
her
head
out
and
says
okay
he's
ready
for
you
go
on
in
to
my
credit
the
first
time
i
enter
the
oval
office
i
do
not
black
out
i
can
remember
this
very
clearly
right
in
front
of
me
i
i
can
see
a
painting
of
the
statue
of
liberty
that
was
done
by
norman
rockwell
that
someone
has
told
me
is
valued
at
twelve
million
dollars
and
behind
me
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
can
see
the
emancipation
proclamation
not
a
photocopy
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
the
emancipation
proclamation
and
i
can
feel
the
message
that
this
document
is
sending
through
the
room
and
that
message
is
i'm
here
cause
i
freed
the
slaves
what
are
you
doing
here
and
i
look
i
look
across
the
desk
at
the
president
and
i
realize
he
may
also
be
wondering
what
i'm
doing
here
but
i
feel
great
i
mean
i've
spent
an
entire
week
just
practicing
how
to
explain
this
one
joke
to
the
president
so
so
i
step
up
i
i
look
at
him
a
and
i
open
my
mouth
and
what
comes
out
is
like
i'm
trying
to
ask
for
directions
but
in
spanish
like
like
the
nouns
and
the
verbs
are
there
but
there's
nothing
in
between
them
i
i
just
say
betty
white
video
nbc
very
funny
everybody
laughs
esta
bien
and
and
the
president
gives
me
kind
of
a
confused
look
and
hope
the
videographer
jumps
in
a
and
and
explains
everything
and
rescues
me
but
i'm
a
little
concerned
because
i
am
here
to
show
the
president
how
professional
i
am
and
in
my
professional
opinion
we
are
not
off
to
a
great
start
still
i
i'm
not
that
worried
because
i
have
that
second
birthday
card
in
my
pocket
and
so
i'm
gonna
get
a
chance
to
show
president
obama
how
i
save
the
day
a
and
as
soon
as
hope
is
finished
filming
even
i
am
surprised
by
how
confident
i
sound
when
i
walk
up
to
the
desk
and
i
put
my
hand
down
and
i
say
mr
president
i'm
gonna
need
to
take
that
birthday
card
and
replace
it
with
this
identical
birthday
card
because
we
don't
want
anyone
to
know
you've
already
written
your
birthday
greeting
and
president
obama
looks
up
at
me
and
he
says
we're
we're
filming
this
from
all
the
way
across
the
room
and
i
say
yes
that's
right
and
he
says
so
no
one's
gonna
see
the
inside
of
the
card
and
i
say
yes
that's
right
and
he
says
so
i
can
just
pretend
to
write
in
the
card
we
don't
actually
need
another
one
and
i
say
yes
that's
right
and
i
put
the
card
back
in
my
pocket
and
it's
strike
two
but
i'm
not
giving
up
yet
cause
i
made
that
promise
to
myself
a
and
besides
i
really
do
feel
good
about
the
the
ending
with
the
headphones
a
and
so
the
moment
hope
is
done
filming
her
second
camera
angle
i
i
walk
back
up
to
the
president
and
i
reach
into
my
pocket
and
i
pull
out
what
looks
like
a
hairball
made
out
of
wires
i
i
don't
really
know
what
happened
i
guess
somewhere
in
that
waiting
room
i
have
just
worried
this
thing
into
a
hopeless
tangle
and
now
i
don't
know
what
to
do
so
i
just
hand
the
entire
thing
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
now
if
you
work
in
the
white
house
you
will
hear
the
phrase
there
is
no
commodity
on
earth
more
valuable
than
a
president's
time
which
i
always
thought
was
a
cliche
until
i
watched
barack
obama
untangle
headphones
for
thirty
seconds
while
looking
directly
at
me
and
he
untangles
and
untangles
and
when
he
finishes
he
looks
at
hope
and
just
goes
pff
shoddy
advance
work
and
he
does
it
in
this
way
that
lets
you
know
that
a
he's
only
joking
and
b
he
is
not
even
a
tiny
bit
joking
a
and
i'll
tell
you
my
heart
just
sinks
i
i
mean
i
this
was
my
third
chance
to
make
a
second
first
impression
on
the
president
and
i
let
myself
down
a
and
all
i
wanna
do
is
get
out
of
there
a
and
president
obama
says
something
like
well
would
it
be
funnier
if
i
bob
my
head
in
time
to
the
music
and
i
say
yeah
that
would
be
funnier
but
my
heart
isn't
in
it
i
mean
i
know
i
don't
belong
there
and
the
president
looks
into
the
camera
to
tape
this
final
scene
and
then
suddenly
he
stops
and
he
says
well
wait
a
second
if
i'm
gonna
bob
my
head
in
time
to
the
music
i
need
to
know
how
the
music
goes
does
anyone
here
know
the
golden
girls
theme
song
and
president
obama
looks
at
hope
and
hope
doesn't
say
anything
so
i
look
at
hope
and
hope
doesn't
say
anything
so
president
obama
looks
at
me
and
suddenly
i
know
exactly
what
i
can
do
for
my
country
and
so
i'm
standing
there
in
the
oval
office
with
the
emancipation
proclamation
right
behind
me
and
i
look
our
commander
in
chief
in
the
eye
and
i
say
bum
bum
bum
bum
thank
you
for
being
a
friend
bum
bum
bum
bum
bum
bum
bum
bum
travel
down
the
road
and
back
again
something
something
you're
a
pal
and
a
confidant
bum
bum
bum
bum
but
he
looks
kind
of
amused
so
i
keep
going
i'm
like
and
if
you
threw
a
party
invited
everyone
you
knew
a
and
that's
when
he
gives
me
a
look
that's
like
okay
president's
time
but
it
works
president
obama
bobs
his
head
in
time
to
the
music
and
betty
white
gets
her
card
and
nbc
gets
their
special
a
and
i
leave
the
oval
office
that
day
with
my
head
held
high
knowing
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
just
a
tiny
bit
better
at
his
job
because
i
was
in
the
room
and
people
still
ask
me
after
that
they
still
say
have
you
met
him
yet
have
you
met
obama
yet
and
i
can
finally
say
yeah
actually
i
have
and
then
just
to
myself
i
think
not
to
brag
or
anything
but
technically
i'm
thankful
he's
a
friend
thank
you
very
much
