
i
love
numbers
i
love
how
straightforward
and
direct
they
are
i
love
how
one
plus
one
is
always
equals
to
two
and
how
two
plus
two
without
a
doubt
equals
to
four
and
so
when
it
was
time
for
us
to
decide
what
we
wanted
to
do
in
university
i
knew
for
sure
that
i
wanted
to
walk
with
numbers
so
you
can
imagine
my
joy
when
i
heard
about
something
called
actuarial
science
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
what
that
is
it's
this
really
amazing
course
that
has
you
spending
your
days
doing
things
like
calculus
and
probability
and
statistics
it's
what
insurance
companies
nee
use
to
know
the
mortality
rates
hence
tell
you
how
much
premium
you
need
to
pay
it's
what
governments
use
to
know
what
areas
to
invest
i
mean
who
wouldn't
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
lives
doing
that
but
just
before
i
went
to
university
i
was
diagnosed
with
epilepsy
and
the
doctor
told
me
that
i
had
to
make
sure
i
did
three
things
eat
well
slept
well
and
never
missed
my
medication
so
i'm
doing
the
doctor's
advice
i
enrolled
to
do
actuarial
science
at
the
university
of
nairobi
a
few
years
into
it
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
an
internship
at
an
insurance
company
i
remember
my
first
day
there
i
had
a
mismatched
suit
but
it
was
a
suit
nevertheless
and
the
director's
assistant
was
assigned
to
show
me
around
and
since
we
were
almost
the
same
age
we
quickly
clicked
and
made
it
a
routine
to
come
very
early
in
the
morning
just
to
share
our
dreams
and
ambitions
a
few
weeks
into
the
job
the
company
got
a
really
big
business
deal
which
meant
all
of
us
had
to
chip
in
and
we
spent
one
friday
afternoon
learning
how
to
use
this
new
fancy
photocopying
machine
on
saturday
morning
when
reported
for
duty
i
got
the
honorable
duty
of
working
with
the
new
photocopying
machine
i
remember
walking
into
the
copier
room
armed
with
a
ream
of
papers
and
a
stack
of
files
that
i
needed
to
photocopy
i
opened
the
machine
just
to
make
sure
it
had
enough
papers
as
we
had
been
instructed
the
day
before
then
i
woke
up
in
the
hospital
and
the
doctor
told
me
that
i
have
something
called
photosensitive
epilepsy
this
is
a
type
that
is
triggered
by
flashing
lights
and
in
my
case
with
the
being
from
the
photocopying
machine
and
since
i
had
a
known
history
of
epilepsy
the
doctor
said
that
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
be
admitted
and
that
i
should
go
home
and
get
some
rest
so
i
went
home
got
some
rest
and
was
looking
forward
to
monday
morning
to
redeem
myself
at
the
workplace
on
monday
morning
i
went
back
to
the
office
and
the
director's
assistant
told
me
that
i
had
been
given
two
weeks
to
get
more
rest
i
was
really
excited
about
this
because
here
i
was
doing
my
dream
job
and
i
was
working
for
a
company
that
cared
about
my
health
and
so
i
went
home
and
i
did
some
research
on
this
photosensitive
epilepsy
so
that
i
i
could
make
sure
it
never
happens
in
the
workplace
again
and
after
the
two
weeks
i
went
back
to
work
and
the
director's
assistant
told
me
that
they'd
given
me
two
more
weeks
this
time
round
i
wasn't
as
excited
as
i
was
before
for
some
reason
deep
within
me
this
two
plus
two
was
not
adding
up
to
four
and
so
in
the
evening
after
work
hours
i
called
the
director's
assistant
and
i
asked
her
if
she
had
heard
anything
about
my
case
and
after
few
minutes
of
silence
in
what
was
almost
like
a
whisper
she
said
to
me
sitawa
the
director
said
that
we
cannot
work
with
someone
like
you
this
meant
that
they
couldn't
work
with
someone
with
a
health
condition
like
mine
and
after
a
few
more
moments
of
silence
she
said
that
he
was
thinking
of
telling
the
person
who'd
introduced
me
to
this
insurance
company
to
break
the
news
to
me
i
can't
really
recall
how
that
phone
conversation
ended
i
don't
know
if
she
hanged
up
first
or
if
i
hanged
up
first
but
i
remember
bursting
out
into
tears
and
i
cried
because
of
the
pain
i
felt
that
the
director
of
this
insurance
company
did
not
have
the
courage
or
the
integrity
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
i
didn't
have
a
job
anymore
but
he
kept
giving
me
two
and
two
more
weeks
off
but
most
of
all
i
cried
because
i
didn't
ask
for
this
i
just
started
falling
down
and
so
after
a
few
days
of
crying
i
turned
my
tears
into
words
and
moved
those
words
to
a
blog
and
before
i
knew
it
people
living
with
epilepsy
were
coming
to
my
blog
for
inspiration
and
information
and
support
and
as
the
numbers
grew
i
started
a
hotline
and
they
were
able
to
get
prompt
support
from
it
i
still
love
numbers
i
love
the
truth
in
them
i
love
the
fact
that
numbers
tell
us
things
about
people
and
from
the
numbers
i
have
interacted
with
i
see
a
future
where
people
like
me
living
with
epilepsy
increase
in
the
workplace
i
also
see
a
future
where
people
working
with
us
know
that
they
can
work
with
us
and
they
can
touch
us
and
they'll
not
get
this
thing
that
we
have
and
this
thing
that
we
have
only
puts
us
down
for

a
little
while
and
after
that
we
are
able
to
rise
up
to
contribute
to
the
wellbeing
of
this
amazing
world
that
we
live
in
