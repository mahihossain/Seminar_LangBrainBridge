um
it
was
five
days
before
my
ten
year
high
school
reunion
when
my
husband
told
me
he
thought
he
might
be
gay
he
wasn't
sure
he
was
gay
cause
he
had
never
been
with
a
man
yet
but
he
thought
it
was
something
he
ought
to
figure
out
good
idea
um
now
i
i
think
he
told
me
this
at
that
moment
not
to
get
out
of
my
high
school
reunion
which
would
be
understandable
but
in
order
to
um
because
we
had
been
looking
for 
houses
together
and
we'd
finally
found
one
in
pasadena
that
we
both
liked
and
i
think
somehow
the
forever
of
the
wedding
vow
sounded
kind
of
vague
and
idealistic
to
him
where
as
thirty
year
mortgage
was
surprisingly
specific
it
was
a
commitment
you
know
the
kind
of
commitment
you
shouldn't
make
while
your
sexuality
is
pending
so
now
i
as
he
was
explaining
this
to
me
i
was
thinking
downstairs
our
neighbors
we
live
in
this
duplex
apartment
we
were
renting
the
kaufmans
were
probably
just
sitting
down
for
dinner
as
they
had
done
for
fifty
two
years
and
talking
about
their
brisket
and 
they
were
this
couple
that
used
to
come
up
and
see
our
new
furniture
like
when
we
bought
a
new
antique
table
cause
sam
liked
antique
shopping
pink
flag
and
um
they
so
they
were
like
parent
figures
to
us
and
um
and
you
know
there
were
signs
like
when
i
first
met
sam
he
had
this
leather
jacket
with
a
tiger
print
lining
and
i
remember
thinking
it
seemed
kinda
the
lining
i
don't
know
it
stuck
with
me
and
then
um
and
you
know
but
then
he
asked
me
out
and
we
slept
together
and
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
i
put
on
the
big
white
dress
which
he
helped
me
pick
out
in
front
seriously
in
in
front
of
um
you
know
two
hundred
close
witnesses
my
closest
friends
and
i
figured
he's
not
um
and
also
i
actually
i
guess
i
there
was
one
thing
i
ignored
which
i
probably
should
have
paid
attention
to
he
told
me
before
we
were
while
we
were
engaged
he
told
me
he
sometimes
noticed
men
but
he
said
he
couldn't
imagine
sleeping
with
a
man
and
you
know
he
just
noticed
them
and
i
guess
i
knew
this
was
not
good
because
i
didn't
talk
to
any
girl
friends
about
this
and
i
talk
to
girl
friends
about
everything
so
if
i
didn't
it
was
probably
bad
but
i
did
at
one
point
i
did
talk
to
one
girl
friend
we
were
in
line
at
disneyland
for
space
mountain
and
i
told
her
how
sam
had
said
he
sometimes
notice
men
and
do
you
think
that's
bad
and
she
said
you
know
she
told
me
this
theory
of
the
spectrum
of
sexuality
and
everyone
lies
somewhere
along
it
and
some
people
notice
people
but
they
would
never
act
on
it
and
uh
well
four
years
later
she
realized
she
was
a
lesbian
so
s
my
one
person
i
confessed
to
um
so
as
i
was
recalling
all
these
signs
i
realized
sam
was
still
talking
and
um
he
was
telling
me
he
felt
so
much
better
getting
this
off
his
chest
and
he'd
been
wanting
to
tell
me
for
a
long
time
and
he
felt
so
relieved
he
he
kind
of
wanted
to
have
sex
and
i
said
with
who
and
he
said
with
you
and
i
think
he
meant
is
as
a
complement
but
i
was
like
i
have
to
go
to
bed
and
wake
up
when
the
book
stores
are
open
so
the
next
day
i
went
directly
to
the
self
help
section
um
where
all
problems
could
be
solved
and
there
was
no
book
for
someone
who's
husband
who
thought
he
might
be
gay
there
was
um
there
was
a
book
called
loving
someone
gay
but
it
turned
out
to
be
for
teachers
and
family
members
um
but
nothing
and
and
um
and
i
was
i
was
nervous
because
this
is
la
and
i
didn't
wanna
pioneer
a
problem
i
this
is
a
ba
very
bad
sign
and
as
i'm
looking
for
a
book
any
book
i
remember
i
saw
one
called
um
how
to
survive
alien
abduction
and
it
wasn't
a
humor
book
it
was
a
serious
book
with
like
things
like
block
their
mind
control
and
you
know
get
help
from
on
high
and
so
basically
according
to
the
laws
of
supply
and
demand
you're
more
likely
to
be
abducted
by
an
alien
than
to
have
your
husband
realize
he's
gay
that's
what
that
said
to
me
and
so
i
um
i
left
the
self
help
section
despondent
and
decided
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
therapy
four
days
now
from
my
high
school
reunion
um
so
i
went
for
the
first
time
i
had
never
gone
to
therapy
i
grew
up
in
oklahoma
which
was
where
my
reunion
was
gonna
be
and
um
i
went
i
there
was
this
thing
called
the
gold
group
cause
i
was
in
a
writer's
guild
basically
when
i
became
a
comedy
writer
i
decided
my
husband
no
longer
wanted
to
be
a
straight
man
that
was
basically
what
happened
there
so
i
was
in
the
writer's
guild
and
um
i
went
they
paid
for
this
gold
this
is
true
they
pay
for
this
thing
called
the
gold
group
and
it
was
a
group
of
therapists
in
the
valley
and
um
it
was
only
a
ten
dollar
co
pay
and
and
it's
possible
you
shouldn't
skimp
on
therapy
but
i
but
i
thought
i
was
gonna
be
in
for
a
while
so
i
um
i
went
to
the
gold
group
and
i
remember
when
i
got
in
there
um
you
basically
get
what
you
co
pay
for
because
there
i
i
was
in
this
office
waiting
for
my
therapist
and
i
could
hear
the
session
next
to
me
it
was
this
paper
thin
wall
and
i
could
hear
a
man
sobbing
and
i
was
like
they're
they're
gonna
hear
me
sobbing
and
then
when
my
therapist
came
in
she
turned
on
this
little
f
oscillating
fan
which
i
think
is
a
system
the
gold
group
had
come
up
with
to
deal
with
the
sound
proofing
problem
and
um
so
and
my
therapist
and
i
didn't
have
anything
to
compare
against
but
i
just
remember
noting
she
was
just
very
badly
dressed
like
pink
and
red
together
and
stripes
and
i
thought
she
can't
put
together
an
outfit
and
she
has
to
put
together
my
whole
life
this
is
not
good
so
um
and
she
had
all
these
questions
i
hadn't
even
thought
of
like
do
you
think
you
should
you
be
hiv
tested
maybe
he's
lying
and
he's
been
cheating
on
you
and
she
had
a
lot
of
anger
that
we
worked
on
so
she
felt
better
um
okay
so
i
proceeded
my
decision
was
to
go
to
the
reunion
with
sam
and
pretend
everything
was
fine
because
it
seemed
better
than
um
well
one
problem
was
sam
wasn't
ready
to
come
out
cause
he
hadn't
started
uh
see
when
he
told
me
he
thought
he
might
be
gay
he
said
maybe
i'll
only
be
thirty
percent
gay
i'll
find
out
and
then
i
could
still
be
with
you
and
i
was
overwhelmed
at
the
moment
but
i
do
remember
thinking
so
he'll
sleep
with
ten
men
and
then
enjoy
three
of
them
i'm
confused
how
we're
gonna
do
the
math
of
this
so
um
so
he
hadn't
started
that
experiment
yet
so
he
wasn't
ready
to
come
out
cause
he
didn't
know
yet
so
we
just
went
to
my
reunion
like
that
so
we
stayed
with
my
parents
which
is
not
a
fun
thing
even
when
your
husband
doesn't
think
he
might
be
gay
and
um
and
my
and
i
remember
at
the
reunion
i
won
most
successful
and
i
just
was
like
yeah
and
my
husband's
gay
so
you
know
it's
oklahoma
the
the
runner
up
was
like
the
manager
of
the
footlocker
so
it
wasn't
a
huge
honor
but
um
but
anyway
i
remember
when
i
went
home
i
was
really
nervous
about
my
mom
cause
my
mom
it
was
like
being
you
know
that
scene
in
my
fair
lady
when
the
linguistic
experts
asked
her
to
dance
that's
how
it
was
like
being
alone
with
my
mom
with
a
secret
cause
my
mom
like
right
now
she
would
say
your
voice
sounds
a
little
tight
honey
you
she's
like
very
eagle
eye
about
these
emotional
things
and
i
kept
worrying
and
trying
to
avoid
her
and
i
completely
thought
forgot
about
my
dad
and
um
at
one
point
he
was
sitting
there
watching
espn
and
he
said
is
everything
okay
and
i
said
no
you
know
if
everything
was
okay
sam
would
be
in
here
watching
espn
with
you
instead
of
in
the
kitchen
flipping
through
house
beautiful
with
mom
and
he
and
i
basically
told
my
dad
everything
which
is
not
the
system
in
my
house
you
tell
my
mom
and
my
mom
tells
my
dad
but
i
told
my
dad
and
um
and
then
i
remembered
why
i
don't
ever
tell
my
dad
because
he
was
like
it
was
like
i
was
ask
he
thought
it
was
as
if
sam
was
asking
permission
to
have
an
affair
and
he
and
i
should
just
say
no
so
he's
in
fact
his
words
were
i'd
like
to
sleep
with
debbie
reynolds
but
your
mom's
not
gonna
let
me
which
i
was
like
but
what
if
you
wanted
to
sleep
with
burt
reynolds
so
and
um
and
to
his
credit
he
had
no
experience
with
this
in
college
he
had
one
you
know
there
was
one
guy
in
his
fraternity
that
everyone
knew
had
realized
he
was
gay
and
left
his
wife
and
kids
jerry
hobbleman
and
no
one
had
ever
heard
from
him
again
that
was
like
his
whole
experience
with
the
gay
population
so
he
was
no
help
and
um
somehow
though
sam
and
i
survived
our
uh
my
highschool
reunion
but
um
mr
kaufman
who
lived
downstairs
did
not
survive
the
weekend
he
had
died
in
his
sleep
of
a
heart
attack
and
there
was
a
funeral
and
um
and
i
remember
it
was
kind
of
a
highlight
for
me
because
i
had
been
crying
in
such
inappropriate
places
all
week
and
finally
i
was
at
a
funeral
and
i
could
just
sob
even
though
i
think
it
was
odd
to
people
cause
they
were
like
is
she
the
tennant
because
i
was
kind
of
losing
it
like
grabbing
kleenex
from
the
mother
you
know
um
but
um
but
i
remember
i
was
there
with
sam
and
we
were
holding
hands
and
we
were
thinking
um
i
was
thinking
if
at
least
at
a
funeral
there's
a
body
and
a
grave
and
um
something
tangible
to
mark
the
end
and
with
a
relationship
it's
never
so
clearly
marked
and
um
it
was
a
relief
to
be
there
with
with
sam
for
closure
and
then
being
at
a
jewish
funeral
there
was
a
need
for
a
minion
where
they
needed
ten
men
to
go
and
i
remember
thinking
don't
go
with
the
men
to
sam
i
did
not
want
him
to
go
with
the
men
but
then
finally
i
said
go
and
i
realized
i
meant
it
in
the
largest
sense
possible
and
about
a
week
later
um
my
dad
called
me
and
he
s
he
said
you
know
it's
a
really
ninety
nine
percent
genetic
this
whole
homosexuality
thing
and
i
was
completely
thrown
and
thought
that
maybe
he
had
been
on
the
internet
and
researching
and
and
it
turned
out
that
my
dad
had
called
jerry
hobbleman
and
asked
him
to
lunch
he
had
tracked
down
this
man
and
took
him
to
denny's
and
um
and
um
i'm
sure
there
were
lots
of
disclaimers
cause
my
dad
does
not
take
men
to
lunch
so
he
probably
was
afraid
it
would
sound
like
a
date
or
something
and
um
i'm
sure
when
he
showed
up
in
shorts
and
black
dress
socks
and
loafers
it
was
clear
he
was
not
of
the
gay
persuasion
but
he
um
but
he
asked
jerry
all
the
things
he
wanted
to
ask
um
my
i
guess
and
couldn't
like
could
you
have
avoided
this
and
did
you
ever
regret
it
and
is
your
wife
okay
and
it
maybe
was
the
nicest
thing
a
father
ever
did
taking
jerry
hobbleman
to
lunch
and
um
just
about
a
week
after
that
sam
was
finally
moving
out
and
um
i
remember
we
were
in
the
top
floor
of
our
duplex
and
downstairs
mrs
kaufman
was
gardening
like
she
always
did
and
um
sam
hadn't
talked
to
her
yet
because
she
was
like
a
parent
figure
and
he
still
wasn't
ready
to
come
out
and
he
wasn't
dealing
with
things
as
he
hadn't
dealt
with
many
things
um
and
so
i
said
you
have
to
tell
her
cause
the
moving
van
is
going
to
be
here
any
minute
and
she's
gonna
wonder
cause
and
he
wouldn't
so
i
went
downstairs
to
talk
to
her
and
um
i
remember
she
was
she'd
always
loved
gardening
but
it
was
really
about
k
she
seemed
more
desperate
than
ever
to
kind
of
keep
things
alive
nurture
the
living
things
and
not
to
let
things
slip
away
and
she
couldn't
imagine
why
i
was
letting
my
husband
slip
away
and
i
couldn't
explain
to
her
um
and
so
we
just
sat
together
on
this
bench
um
shoulder
to
shoulder
two
women
alone
but
not
really
alone
as
the
moving
van
lumbered
over
to
the
sidewalk
thank
you
