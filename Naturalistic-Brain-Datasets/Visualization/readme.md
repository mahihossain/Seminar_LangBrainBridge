To visualize brain plots, you need the transform and surface for the specific participant that is not publicly available. This data is sensitive as it can be potentially used to identify an individual. In case you need this data, please ask us for access.

Then:

- Install pycortex from https://gallantlab.org/pycortex/install.html. The 'Basic Configuration' part is important. Once you've followed these instructions and specified a specific path for the file store (e.g., '/abs/path/to/filestore'), you should move the whole subject folders to the same directory (/abs/path/to/filestore).
- Follow the example to plot data.
- Open the link http://127.0.0.1:----- with the port number displayed in the terminal.
