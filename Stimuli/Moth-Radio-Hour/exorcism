so
i'm
not
depressed
now
but
i
was
depressed
for
a
long
time
and
i
wrote
about
being
depressed
and
i
lived
for
a
long
time
with
blinding
depression
and
had
long
stretches
when
everything
seemed
hopeless
and
pointless
when
returning
calls
from
friends
seemed
like
more
than
i
could
do
when
getting
up
and
going
out
into
the
world
seemed
painful
when
i
was
completely
crippled
with
anxiety
and
when
i
finally
got
better
and
started
writing
about
the
process
of
recovery
i
became
very
interested
in
all
of
the
different
kinds
of
treatment
that
there
were
for
depression
and
having
started
as
a
kind
of
medical
conservative
thinking
that
there
were
only
a
couple
of
things
that
worked
medication
and
certain
talking
therapies
and
that
that
was
really
it
i
very
gradually
began
to
change
my
mind
because
i
realized
that
if
you
have
brain
cancer
and
you
decide
that
standing
on
your
head
and
gargling
for
half
an
hour
every
day
makes
you
feel
better
it
may
make
you
feel
better
but
the
likelihood
is
that
you
still
have
brain
cancer
and
you're
still
going
to
die
from
it
but
if
you
have
depression
and
you
say
that
standing
on
your
head
and
gargling
for
half
an
hour
makes
you
feel
better
then
you
are
actually
cured
because
depression
is
an
illness
of
how
you
feel
and
if
you
feel
really
great
after
you
do
that
then
you're
not
depressed
any
more
but
i
began
to
think
all
kinds
of
things
could
work
and
i
researched
everything
ranging
from
experimental
brain
surgeries
to
hypnotic
ruh
regimens
of
various
kinds
i
had
people
writing
to
me
because
i
had
been
publishing
on
this
subject
there
was
one
woman
who
wrote
to
me
and
she
said
that
she
had
tried
actually
electroshock
treatments
and
a
variety
of
other
approaches
to
depression
medication
and
therapy
and
she
had
finally
found
the
thing
that
worked
for
her
and
she
wanted
me
to
tell
the
world
about
it
and
that
was
making
little
things
from
yarn
um
some
of
which
she
sent
me
and
none
of
which
i'm
wearing
right
now
but
in
any
event
uh
tha
i
had
that
um
uh
that
rich
engagement
and
i
also
became
interested
as
i
was
doing
this
work
in
the
idea
that
depression
existed
not
only
in
the
civilized
west
as
people
tended
to
perceive
it
to
exist
but
actually
across
cultures
and
had
existed
across
time
and
so
when
one
of
my
dearest
friends
my
friend
david
hecht
who
was
living
for
a
little
while
in
senegal
said
to
me
do
you
know
about
the
tribal
rituals
that
are
used
for
the
treatment
of
depression
here
i
said
no
i
don't
know
about
them
but
i
would
like
to
know
about
them
and
he
said
well
if
you
come
for
a
visit
we
could
try
to
do
some
research
on
this
topic
and
so
i
set
off
for
senegal
and
i
met
david
and
i
was
introduced
to
david's
then
girlfriend
now
ex
wife
elene
and
um
it
turned
out
that
elene
had
a
cousin
whose
mother
was
a
friend
of
someone
who
went
to
school
with
the
daughter
of
a
person
who
actually
practiced
the
ndepp
and
that
i
could
therefore
go
and
interview
this
woman
who
had
practiced
the
ndepp
and
so
we
went
off
to
um
a
small
town
about
two
hours
outside
of
dakar
and
uh
i
was
introduced
to
this
extraordinary
old
large
woman
wrapped
in
miles
and
miles
of
african
fabric
printed
with
figures
of
eyes
and
she
was
madame
diof
and
we
did
an
interview
for
about
an
hour
and
she
told
me
all
about
the
ndepp
and
at
the
end
of
it
feeling
rather
daring
i
said
um
listen
i
said
i
i
hope
i
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
something
you
would
even
consider
i
said
but
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
attend
an
ndepp
and
she
said
well
i
certainly
never
had
a
foreigner
the
local
word
was
toobob
i've
never
had
a
foreigner
attend
one
of
these
before
she
said
but
actually
she
said
i
mean
you've
come
through
these
friends
and
these
connections
she
said
yes
the
next
time
i
perform
an
ndepp
you
may
be
present
and
i
said
that's
fantastic
i
said
when
are
you
next
gonna
be
doing
an
ndepp
and
she
said
oh
it'll
be
some
time
in
the
next
six
months
and
i
said
six
months
is
quite
a
long
time
for
me
to
stay
here
in
this
town
waiting
for
you
to
do
one
i
said
is
there
anyone
who
might
maybe
we
could
expedite
one
for
somebody
move
it
forward
um
i'll
pitch
in
um
she
said
no
it
really
doesn't
work
that
way
she
said
i'm
sorry
but
um
uh
that
that's
that's
how
it
is
and
i
said
well
i
guess
i
won't
be
able
to
see
an
ndepp
then
but
even
so
this
conversation
has
been
so
interesting
and
so]
helpful
to
me
and
and
i
i'm
a
little
sad
leaving
here
about
not
actually
getting
to
see
one
but
but
i
thank
you
and
she
said
well
i'm
i'm
glad
that
you
could
come
i'm
glad
it
was
helpful
and
she
said
um
but
there
is
one
other
thing
she
said
uh
i
i
hope
you
don't
mind
my
saying
this
and
i
said
well
no
what
what
is
it
and
she
said
you
don't
look
that
great
yourself
she
said
are
you
you
are
suffering
from
depression
and
i
said
well
yes
i
said
i
i
was
very
acute
it's
kind
of
a
little
better
now
but
yeah
i
still
do
actually
suffer
from
depression
she
said
well
i've
certainly
never
done
this
for
a
toobob
before
but
i
could
actually
do
an
ndepp
for
you
and
i
said
oh
i
said
what
an
what
an
interesting
idea
i
said
well
um
yes
uh
sure
yeah
abso
yes
let's
let's
let's
do
that
i
said
that
i'll
have
an
ndepp
and
she
said
oh
well
that's
great
she
said
and
she
gave
us
some
uhh
um
uhh
some
sort
of
fairly
basic
instructions
and
then
we
left
and
my
translator
the
aforementioned
then
girlfriend
now
ex
wife
of
my
friend
turned
to
me
and
she
said
are
you
completely
crazy
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you're
getting
yourself
into
and
i
said
well
you
know
i'm
i'm
all
these
things
very
interesting
she
said
you're
crazy
she
said
you're
totally
crazy
but
i'll
help
you
if
you
want
so
we
had
left
and
the
first
thing
we
had
was
a
shopping
list
there
had
been
a
she
had
k
you
could
get
them
to
buy
the
stuff
but
you
had
to
pay
a
surcharge
i'd
said
no
we'd
buy
the
stuff
so
we
had
to
go
out
we
had
to
buy
seven
yards
of
african
fabric
um
we
had
to
get
um
a
calabash
which
was
a
large
bowl
fashioned
from
a
gourd
we
had
to
get
um
three
kilos
of
millet
we
had
to
get
sugar
we
had
to
get
kola
beans
and
then
we
had
to
get
two
live
cockerels
two
roosters
and
a
ram
um
and
so
elene
and
i
went
to
the
market
with
david
and
with
these
other
um
people
and
we
got
most
of
the
things
and
i
said
well
but
what
what
about
the
the
ram
and
elene
said
we
can't
buy
the
ram
today
what
are
we
gonna
do
with
it
overnight
so
i
saw
the
sense
of
that
so
the
next
day
the
next
day
we
got
into
a
taxi
to
go
back
out
two
hours
to
where
we
were
going
and
i
said
what
about
the
ram
and
elene
said
oh
we'll
see
a
ram
along
the
way
so
we
were
going
along
and
going
along
and
there
was
a
senegalese
shepherd
by
the
side
of
the
road
with
his
flock
and
we
stopped
the
cab
and
we
got
out
and
we
bought
the
ram
for
seven
dollars
and
then
we
had
a
little
bit
of
a
struggle
getting
the
live
ram
into
the
trunk
of
the
taxi
cab
um
so
but
the
cab
driver
seemed
not
at
all
worried
even
by
the
fact
that
the
ram
kept
relieving
himself
in
the
trunk
of
the
taxi
cab
um
and
so
then
we
got
to
um
rufisque
and
we
got
there
i
said
well
here
i
am
i'm
ready
um
for
my
close
up
and
uh
the
thing
about
the
ndepp
is
that
it
varies
enormously
depending
on
a
whole
variety
of
signals
and
symbols
that
come
from
above
so
we
had
to
go
through
this
whole
shamanistic
process
and
i
still
didn't
know
really
very
much
of
what
was
gonna
happen
so
first
i
had
to
change
out
of
my
jeans
and
my
t
shirt
and
put
on
a
loincloth
and
then
i
sat
down
and
then
i
had
my
chest
and
my
arms
rubbed
with
millet
and
then
um
which
is
a
grain
and
then
someone
said
oh
we
really
should
have
music
um
for
this
and
i
said
oh
great
and
i
thought
you
know
drumming
i
thought
some
atmospheric
thing
and
she
came
out
with
her
very
prized
possession
which
was
a
battery
operated
tape
player
for
which
she
had
one
tape
which
was
chariots
of
fire
so
we
started
listening
to
chariots
of
fire
and
in
the
meanwhile
i
was
given
sort
of
various
shamanistic
objects
i
had
to
hold
with
my
hands
and
drop
them
i
had
to
hold
them
with
my
feet
and
drop
them
i
had
to
they
would
sort
of
say
oh
this
augers
well
this
augers
badly
there
were
five
assistants
to
madame
diof
who
had
all
gathered
around
and
we
sort
of
spent
the
morning
like
this
and
it
was
all
really
um
just
fine
and
then
um
they
said
it
was
maybe
we'd
started
at
about
eight
maybe
about
eleven
eleven
thirty
they
said
well
now
it's
actually
time
for
the
the
central
part
of
the
ritual
and
i
said
oh
ok
and
the
sound
of
drumming
began
the
drumming
i'd
been
hoping
for
the
drumming
began
and
so
there
was
all
of
this
drumming
and
it
was
very
exciting
and
we
um
went
to
the
central
square
of
the
village
where
there
was
a
small
makeshift
wedding
bed
that
i
had
to
get
into
with
the
ram
um
and
i
had
been
told
it
would
be
very
very
bad
luck
if
the
ram
escaped
and
that
i
had
to
hold
onto
him
and
that
the
reason
we
had
to
be
in
this
wedding
bed
was
that
all
my
depression
and
all
my
problems
were
caused
by
the
fact
that
i
had
spirits
in
senegal
you
have
spirits
sort
of
all
over
you
the
way
here
you
sort
of
have
microbes
some
are
good
for
you
some
are
bad
for
you
some
are
neutral
anyway
my
bad
spirits
were
extremely
jealous
of
my
real
life
sexual
partners
um
some
of
whom
are
here
tonight
and
um
uh
and
that
we
had
to
um
mollify
the
anger
of
the
um
of
the
spirits
so
i
had
to
get
into
this
wedding
bed
with
the
ram
and
i
had
to
hold
the
ram
very
tightly
because
he
he
was
not
having
a
good
life
this
ram
um
and
he
of
course
immediately
relieved
himself
on
my
leg
and
the
entire
village
had
taken
the
day
off
from
their
work
in
the
fields
and
were
dancing
around
us
in
concentric
circles
and
as
they
danced
throwing
blankets
and
sheets
of
cloth
over
us
and
so
we
were
gradually
being
buried
and
it
was
unbelievably
hot
and
it
was
completely
stifling
and
there
was
the
sound
of
these
stamping
feet
as
everyone
danced
around
us
and
then
these
drums
which
were
getting
louder
and
louder
and
more
ecstatic
and
more
ecstatic
and
i
was
just
about
at
the
point
at
which
i
thought
i
was
gonna
faint
or
pass
out
at
that
key
moment
um
suddenly
all
of
the
cloths
were
pulled
off
i
was
yanked
to
my
feet
the
loincloth
that
was
all
i
was
wearing
was
pulled
from
me
the
poor
old
ram's
throat
was
slit
um
as
were
the
throats
of
the
two
cockerels
and
i
was
covered
in
the
blood
of
the
freshly
slaughtered
ram
and
the
cockerels
um
and
so
there
i
was
naked
totally
covered
in
blood
and
they
said
okay
that's
the
end
of
this
part
of
it
and
um
i
said
well
okay
and
they
said
um
but
uh
you
uh
uh
they
said
we're
actually
we
but
there's
uh
the
next
piece
comes
now
and
i
said
ok
and
we
went
over
back
to
the
area
where
we'd
done
the
morning
preparations
and
one
of
them
said
but
look
it's
it's
kind
of
lunch
time
why
don't
we
just
take
a
break
for
a
minute
would
you
like
a
coke
i
i
don't
drink
coke
that
much
but
at
that
moment
it
seemed
like
a
really
really
really
good
idea
and
i
said
yes
and
so
i
sat
there
naked
and
completely
covered
in
animal
blood
um
with
flies
kind
of
gathering
as
they
will
when
you're
naked
and
covered
in
animal
blood
and
i
i
drank
this
coke
and
then
when
i
had
finished
the
coke
they
said
ok
now
we
have
the
sort
of
final
parts
of
the
ritual
they
said
um
so
first
you
have
to
put
your
your
hands
by
your
sides
and
and
hold
your
stand
very
straight
and
very
erect
and
i
said
oh
okay
and
then
they
tied
me
up
with
the
intestines
of
the
ram
um
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
hanging
from
a
nearby
tree
and
they
were
there
was
someone
sort
of
doing
some
butchering
of
it
and
they
took
various
little
bits
of
it
out
and
then
i
had
to
kind
of
shuffle
over
all
tied
up
in
in
intestines
which
most
of
you
probably
haven't
done
but
it's
hard
um
i
had
to
shuffle
over
and
i
had
to
take
these
little
pieces
of
the
ram
and
i
had
to
dig
holes
and
i
had
to
put
the
pieces
of
the
ram
in
the
holes
and
i
had
to
say
something
what
i
had
to
say
was
actually
to
me
incredibly
strangely
touching
in
the
middle
of
this
weird
experience
i
had
to
say
spirits
leave
me
alone
to
complete
the
business
of
my
life
and
know
that
i
will
never
forget
you
and
i
thought
what
a
kind
thing
to
say
to
the
evil
spirits
you're
exorcising
that
i'll
never
forget
you
and
i
haven't
so
anyway
there
were
various
other
little
bits
and
pieces
that
followed
i
was
given
a
piece
of
paper
in
which
all
of
the
millet
from
the
morning
had
been
gathered
i
was
told
that
the
next
morning
i
i
should
sleep
with
it
under
my
pillow
and
in
the
morning
get
up
and
give
it
to
a
beggar
who
had
good
hearing
and
no
deformities
and
that
when
i
gave
it
to
him
that
would
be
the
end
of
my
troubles
and
then
the
women
sort
of
all
filled
their
mouths
with
water
and
began
spitting
water
all
over
me
which
it
turns
out
is
the
sort
of
you
know
it's
the
surround
shower
effect
and
rinsing
the
blood
away
from
me
and
it
gradually
came
off
and
when
i
was
clean
they
gave
me
back
my
jeans
and
everyone
danced
and
they
barbecued
the
ram
and
we
had
this
dinner
and
i
felt
so
up
i
felt
so
up
it
had
it
had
been
quite
an
astonishing
experience
even
though
i
didn't
believe
in
the
animist
principles
behind
it
all
of
these
people
had
been
gathered
together
cheering
for
me
and
it
was
very
exhilarating
and
i
had
a
very
odd
experience
five
years
later
when
i
was
working
on
my
current
book
and
i
was
in
rwanda
doing
something
else
altogether
and
i
got
into
a
conversation
with
someone
there
and
i
described
the
experience
i'd
had
in
senegal
and
he
said
oh
you
know
we
have
something
that's
a
little
like
that
he
said
that's
west
africa
this
is
east
africa
it's
quite
different
but
there
are
some
similarities
um
in
some
rituals
here
he
said
you
know
we
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
western
mental
health
workers
who
came
here
immediately
after
the
genocide
and
we
had
to
ask
some
of
them
to
leave
and
i
said
but
what
was
the
problem
and
he
said
okay
they
came
and
their
practice
did
not
involve
being
outside
in
the
sun
like
what
you're
describing
which
is
after
all
where
you
begin
to
feel
better
there
was
no
music
or
drumming
to
get
your
blood
flowing
again
when
you're
depressed
and
you're
low
and
you
need
to
have
your
blood
flowing
he
said
there
was
no
sense
that
everyone
had
taken
the
day
off
so
that
the
entire
community
could
come
together
to
try
to
lift
you
up
and
bring
you
back
to
joy
he
said
there
was
no
acknowledgement
the
depression
as
something
invasive
and
external
that
could
actually
be
cast
out
of
you
again
he
said
instead
they
would
take
people
one
at
a
time
into
these
dingy
little
rooms
and
have
them
sit
around
for
an
hour
or
so
and
talk
about
bad
things
that
had
happened
to
them
he
said
we
had
to
get
them
to
leave
the
country
thank
you
