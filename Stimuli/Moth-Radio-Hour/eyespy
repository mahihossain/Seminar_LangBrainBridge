
hi
i
grew
up
in
providence
rhode
island
and
for
my
entire
childhood
we
were
never
more
than
twenty
miles
away
from
the
core
of
our
universe
the
kennedys
we
were
irish
they
were
irish
we
were
catholic
they
were
catholic
they
were
family
we
were
like
the
relatives
that
they
never
got
to
see
but
we
knew
you
know
they're
busy
and
we
knew
that
they
loved
us
so
anything
so
anything
that
was
happening
to
them
was
also
happening
to
us
so
their
tragedy
plus
our
own
tragedy
was
a
lot
so
this
one
thanksgiving
after
dinner
and
a
family
fight
at
grandma's
house
um
we
were
in
the
car
and
were
driving
home
and
the
radio
was
playing
this
tenth
uh
anniversary
of
the
jfk
assassination
and
i'm
sitting
in
the
back
seat
and
i
start
to
cry
and
my
sister
erin
says
hey
dad
mikayla's
crying
and
my
father
pulls
that
car
right
over
to
the
shoulder
of
i
ninety
five
he
stops
it
he
turns
around
and
he
looks
at
us
and
with
tears
in
his
own
eyes
he
says
don't
you
ever
be
ashamed
to
cry
for
that
man
so
my
parents
grew
up
near
newport
and
they
got
married
in
the
same
exact
churc
as
church
as
jack
and
jackie
saint
mary's
and
my
father
gave
exact
replica
jewelry
to
my
mother
that
was
replications
of
the
jewelry
that
jack
gave
to
jackie
and
every
saturday
night
after
mass
my
family
would
be
in
the
living
room
and
we'd
be
happily
ever
aftering
to
the
original
soundtrack
of
camelot
and
every
year
during
the
seventies
my
four
aunts
would
take
me
and
my
two
cousins
on
their
dream
vacation
a
rented
beach
house
in
hyannis
on
the
very
cove
sharing
beachfront
with
the
kennedy
compound
every
day
for
an
entire
week
my
aunt
pat
would
roll
up
her
sisters'
hair
my
aunts
would
apply
sunscreen
to
the
back
of
their
necks
the
backs
of
the
hands
and
the
tops
of
their
feet
and
then
they
would
drag
their
beach
chairs
down
to
the
beach
and
they
would
set
them
up
perfectly
not
facing
the
water
not
into
the
sun
for
tanning
but
perfectly
for
spying
on
the
kennedys
they
would
sit
there
all
day
in
the
broiling
sun
with
high
powered
binoculars
and
keep
a
constant
surveillance
and
every
year
they'd
have
the
same
exact
conversations
usually
around
mid
morning
the
first
sighting
would
be
made
usually
by
my
aunt
pat
she'd
be
ah
they
got
rose
out
walking
ethel
looks
drawn
and
then
about
an
hour
later
my
aunt
gurt
would
say
how
old
is
rose
now
and
aunt
momo
would
make
the
calculations
well
let's
see
jack
died
in
sixty
three
when
she
was
seventy
four
and
rose's
birthday
was
two
weeks
last
thursday
and
joe
died
in
sixty
nine
making
her
a
widow
at
eighty
one
so
eighty
five
and
then
they'd
break
for
lunch
so
after
lobster
and
drawn
butter
and
hosing
us
down
they'd
all
huffle
back
to
their
posts
and
they'd
watch
and
every
now
and
then
there'd
be
something
they
didn't
know
hey
who's
that
who's
that
who's
that
so
they
draw
out
the
family
tree
in
the
sand
they'd
analyze
it
they'd
come
up
with
a
profile
and
they'd
crack
the
code
it's
one
of
bobby's
now
any
mention
of
bobby
would
always
bring
up
the
inevitable
oh
i
just
pray
to
god
they
don't
tell
poor
senile
rose
about
bobby
it'll
break
her
so
then
the
long
afternoon
stretch
would
end
with
the
inevitable
annual
observation
you
don't
see
jackie
much
here
and
then
all
of
my
aunts
would
drop
their
binoculars
and
look
at
each
other
meaningfully
now
all
of
this
meant
that
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
me
and
my
cousins
in
the
water
and
the
summer
when
we
were
nine
years
old
we
found
something
now
had
an
aunt
perhaps
in
an
effort
to
ease
a
cramp
in
her
prying
neck
just
sort
of
glanced
towards
the
water
she
might
have
seen
us
climbing
into
this
tiny
plastic
half
inflated
boat
she
might
have
cried
out
in
alarm
at
the
lack
of
oars
and
life
vests
she
might
have
had
a
conniption
fit
to
see
us
shove
off
and
drift
into
the
violent
riptide
that
would
sweep
us
within
five
minutes
out
to
the
open
sea
and
the
nantucket
bound
ferry
but
an
aunt
didn't
and
we
did
it
all
happened
so
fast
that
we
were
swept
out
and
it
wasn't
until
we
realized
that
we
could
make
out
the
specific
features
of
the
ferry
passengers
that
we
were
really
far
from
shore
we
were
so
far
from
shore
that
my
aunts
were
now
reduced
to
four
hopping
dots
uh
oh
it
was
like
gilligan's
island
for
real
so
an
atlantic
swell
crashes
over
our
heads
and
as
soon
as
the
water
clears
out
of
our
eyes
a
power
boat
pulls
up
out
of
nowhere
and
in
this
power
boat
are
david
and
michael
kennedy
so
david
and
michael
pull
us
up
into
the
boat
and
we
are
like
oh
my
god
we
are
saved
by
a
power
boat
so
the
power
boat
sends
us
back
to
shore
and
we're
psyched
cause
we're
saved
until
we
start
to
watch
the
four
hopping
dots
morph
back
into
our
four
crazed
livid
aunts
we
are
so
gonna
get
it 
now
my
family
under
any
circumstances
has
this
really
weird
thing
well
they
each
have
like
their
own
weird
thing
about
like
yelling
and
getting
into
huge
trouble
like
my
aunt
gurt
like
she
gets
so
freaked
out
that
all
she
can
do
is
yell
out
our
addresses
like
ilene
and
kevin
two
seventy
five
hooper
street
mikayla
one
eighty
asylum
road
i
swear
to
god
i
grew
up
on
asylum
road
um
very
telling
piece
of
my
childhood
um
or
in
my
aunt
pat
would
do
these
things
where
she
would
say
these
things
that
were
like
actually
kind
of
nice
things
but
she'd
say
them
like
they
were
death
threats
she'd
be
like
yeah
i'll
save
you
from
drowning
you
get
on
that
beach
towel
and
you
lie
in
that
sun
now
or
she'd
say
i'm
gonna
buy
you
a
birthday
present
you
eat
that
cake
now
so
we
knew
that
this
was
what
was
coming
the
kennedy
boys
didn't
so
they're
vivaciously
tanned
and
they
pull
up
to
the
shoreline
and
we
brace
ourselves
now
what
happens
is
our
aunts
are
out
of
their
minds
they're
ready
to
flay
us
but
when
they
see
us
in
the
same
boat
as
the
kennedys
it's
like
they
don't
have
the
emotional
capacity
to
handle
it
they
kinda
snap
they're
kinda
like
freaking
out
to
yell
at
us
but
they
start
fake
smiling
and
trying
to
act
all
normal
and
my
aunt
momo
she's
like
takes
on
this
like
kennedy
esque
way
of
speaking
which
is
sort
of
halfway
between
katherine
hepburn
and
like
the
queen
of
england
and
we're
like
looking
at
them
like
what
are
you
guys
doing
and
they're
smiling
this
smile
but
when
they
smile
at
us
it's
like
you
just
wait
but
they're
like
oh
david
oh
michael
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
and
they're
not
mad
at
us
for
almost
drowning
they're
mad
at
us
because
the
kennedys
had
to
save
us
like
don't
those
people
have
enough
trouble
now
you
like
as
if
our
almost
drowning
was
yet
another
kennedy
tragedy
so
these
poor
boys
finally
pull
and
pry
themselves
away
from
my
aunts
they
get
back
on
the
boat
and
they're
leaving
and
my
aunt
momo's
going
please
give
our
best
to
your
grandmother
and
now
it's
time
for
our
for
real
punishment
which
was
that
we
for
the
rest
of
vacation
had
to
stay
on
the
beach
because
we
did
not
have
any
respect
for
the
water
so
it's
a
hundred
degrees
out
and
after
about
a
half
hour
of
whining
and
fighting
and
like
um
emptying
out
all
the
coppertone
and
kicking
sand
we
break
my
aunt
pat's
last
nerve
and
she
says
alright
you
can
go
in
the
water
but
only
up
to
your
knees
so
we're
happy
for
a
minute
until
we
get
in
the
water
and
realize
how
boring
up
to
your
knees
is
and
then
we
get
the
great
plan
of
having
chicken
fights
so
we
start
to
have
chicken
fights
but
it's
kinda
weird
because
there's
only
three
of
us
so
but
we're
doing
the
best
we
can
to
have
a
chicken
fight
like
that
and
like
knock
each
other
off
into
the
water
so
we
get
fully
immersed
and
then
my
uncle
al
who
never
ever
played
with
us
ever
comes
into
the
water
to
play
chicken
fights
with
us
and
he
puts
his
daughter
my
cousin
ilene
up
on
his
shoulders
and
then
i
get
up
on
my
cousin
kevin's
shoulders
and
we're
having
chicken
fights
and
it's
like
actual
family
fun
for
a
moment
and
we're
like
you
know
hitting
each
other
falling
in
the
water
and
then
i
take
my
foot
and
i
accidentally
kick
the
side
of
my
uncle
al's
head
really
really
hard
and
his
eyeball
pops
out
of
his
head
falls
into
the
water
and
sinks
it
pops
out
of
his
head
and
it
sinks
ilene
kevin
and
i
are
in
instant
complete
shock
right
this
minute
there
is
still
a
part
of
me
that
is
on
that
beach
screaming
it's
like
oh
my
god
we
had
no
idea
that
he
had
a
fake
eye
we
didn't
even
know
that
you
could
have
a
fake
eye
why
would
you
have
a
fake
eye
they
did'nt
tell
us
that
you
that
uncle
al
had
a
fake
eye
cause
they
didn't
want
us
blabbing
it
to
the
whole
neighborhood
so
they
didn't
tell
us
so
we
didn't
know
and
like
later
on
you
know
there
was
columbo
and
sandy
duncan
but
this
was
way
before
that
we
had
no
idea
so
we're
all
standing
there
and
it's
like
so
horrible
like
i
can't
even
like
i'm
like
oh
my
god
and
and
my
cousins
ilene
and
kevin
are
staring
at
me
with
complete
hate
like
you
broke
our
dad
and
my
uncle
al
is
standing
there
and
he's
got
the
lid
open
so
you
can
like
see
inside
the
socket
where
now
it's
just
like
skin
and
the
eyeball
gone
and
like
you
cannot
just
say
i'm
sorry
to
someone
that
you
just
so
i
don't
know
what
to
do
and
my
aunt
pat
is
hysterically
screaming
because
that
eyeball
cost
top
dollar
it
was
a
special
magnetized
eye
so
it
could
keep
up
with
the
other
one
and
now
i
had
just
better
pray
that
vacation
was
over
and
that
they
got
that
deposit
back
because
now
they
were
gonna
have
to
buy
a
brand
new
top
dollar
eye
that
was
not
in
the
budget
so
i
just
didn't
know
what
to
do
i
was
like
my
life
is
over
i
am
no
longer
mikayla
i
am
now
merce
girl
who
kicked
al's
eye
out
in
the
cape
and
it's
awful
and
everybody's
just
crying
and
pointing
at
me
and
now
my
other
aunts
are
getting
in
on
it
like
in
who's
the
blame
part
of
the
conversation's
happening
so
i
just
kind
of
back
off
into
the
water
i'm
kinda
like
going
back
and
like
regressing
back
to
like
where
life
as
i
once
knew
it
had
ended
and
i
just
stand
there
and
like
i
kinda
wish
i
had
drowned
and
i
kinda
wish
the
kennedys
hadn't
saved
me
and
i
bent
off
and
into
the
waves
and
i
just
i
just
start
like
sifting
through
sand
and
shells
and
pebbles
and
it's
totally
ridiculous
but
like
i
will
never
stop
looking
for
this
eye
i
am
gonna
look
forever
and
i
keep
looking
and
looking
and
i'm
sifting
through
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
is
an
eyeball
in
my
palm
fa
staring
right
at
me
and
so
i
scream
and
i
drop
it
back
and
it
sinks
back
into
the
water
but
now
we
know
it's
possible
so
everybody
gets
back
into
the
water
and
now
we're
all
sifting
through
and
sifting
through
and
i
pray
to
god
for
no
more
future
happiness
until
we
find
this
eye
and
i
also
kinda
pray
that
it
not
be
me
the
one
that
finds
it
this
time
so
after
like
an
hour
my
cousin
kevin
finds
the
eye
and
he
holds
it
up
in
triumph
and
he
does
not
let
go
and
my
uncle
al
takes
the
eye
he
like
washes
it
off
and
just
pops
it
back
in
and
then
he
kinda
like
tests
it
you
know
and
it's
like
keeping
up
with
the
other
one
so
it's
working
still
and
now
it's
the
weirdest
thing
because
now
we
know
it's
a
fake
eye
and
now
that
you
know
it's
a
fake
eye
it's
totally
looks
like
a
fake
eye
and
i
can't
believe
that
i
never
noticed
it
wasn't
a
fake
eye
before
so
now
vacation's
back
on
and
so
everybody
gets
back
in
their
beach
chairs
and
they
start
to
settle
down
to
begin
telling
the
story
over
and
over
like
a
million
times
about
what
i
just
did
and
i
have
not
really
fully
reintegrated
back
into
the
family
yet
i'm
kind
of
standing
apart
and
i
notice
that
there
actually
has
been
like
kind
of
a
group
of
people
who
have
been
watching
this
whole
thing
and
then
i
see
something
that
i
didn't
notice
that
no
one
noticed
and
that's
that
two
of
the
kennedy
kids
david
and
michael
had
taken
a
walk
on
the
beach
and
i
can
tell
just
by
the
look
on
thier
faces
that
they
had
sit
there
and
seen
the
entire
episode
that
they
had
been
there
watching
us
thank
you
