my
story
is
about
a
number
of
jobs
that
sort
of
shaped
my
life
and
shaped
my
whole
destiny
and
it
was
a
couple
of
jobs
i
had
uh
during
the
ages
of
twenty
to
twenty
one
so
the
story
begins
in
in
uh
yes
i
we
yes
i
was
employed
back
then
ok
i
don't
know
why
you
laughed
but
i'll
i'll
accept
that
it's
a
good
sign
ok
thinking
out
loud
here
alright
so
in
nineteen
eighty
four
i
was
a
sophomore
at
princeton
you
can
laugh
at
that
if
you
like
no
alright
so
in
nineteen
eighty
four
i
was
a
sophomore
at
princeton
i
wanted
to
take
a
year
off
because
i
had
i
had
a
very
bad
reputation
at
school
i
was
drinking
a
lot
getting
in
a
lot
of
trouble
so
i
wanted
to
take
a
year
off
also
i
had
joined
the
army
to
pay
for
princeton
and
i
was
looking
at
four
years
of
active
duty
after
school
and
eight
years
of
reserve
duty
so
this
was
my
last
chance
at
freedom
was
after
s
you
know
was
taking
this
year
off
from
school
later
just
for
the
harper's
crowd
i
did
become
a
conscientious
objector
and
so
i
got
out
of
the
military
so
and
avoided
the
golf
war
unlike
my
fellow
r
o
t
c
guys
which
was
a
good
thing
alright
so
but
this
was
before
i
knew
i
was
getting
out
of
the
army
this
was
gonna
be
my
year
of
freedom
i
nee
i
needed
to
make
money
though
during
this
year
off
and
a
friend
of
mine
i
know
it's
going
to
seem
absurd
suggested
that
i
be
a
model
and
he
took
some
pictures
of
me
i
know
i
have
rings
under
my
eyes
that
go
all
the
way
to
the
back
of
my
skull
and
i
have
no
hair
but
at
twenty
he
had
it
in
his
mind
that
i
should
be
a
model
so
he
takes
some
pictures
of
me
and
i
must
admit
i
i
thought
i
was
ugly
but
i
was
vain
enough
to
try
it
i
don't
know
what
i
was
thinking
so
i
go
i
look
up
in
the
princeton
library
they
had
a
manhattan
phone
book
and
i
look
up
modeling
and
i
choose
a
modeling
agency
and
i
go
into
new
york
with
these
pictures
this
fellow
takes
them
he
says
can
i
hold
these
overnight
i
said
yes
and
uh
the
next
morning
he
calls
me
come
into
new
york
we
want
to
sign
you
to
a
contract
he'd
sent
my
pictures
to
the
photographer
bruce
weber
who
does
the
abercormbie
and
fitch
and
vanity
fair
however
you
say
abercrombie
whatever
and
uh
that
this
fellow
wanted
to
photograph
me
so
suddenly
with
this
small
agency
which
existed
for
about
a
year
and
then
there
was
a
scandal
with
young
female
models
from
minnesota
closed
down
but
so
suddenly
i'm
a
model
and
i'm
going
off
to
this
bruce
weber
photo
shoot
and
i
remember
we
met
early
in
the
morning
a
bunch
of
us
a
bunch
of
male
models
and
a
van
and
as
we're
going
for
to
uh
the
hamptons
for
this
photo
shoot
it's
like
six
am
this
one
guy
looks
around
he's
from
texas
he
goes
hey
we're
all
blond
you
know
just
it
dawned
on
him
sort
of
uh
as
kind
of
interesting
and
so
we
get
out
to
the
hamptons
and
we're
at
this
farmhouse
and
it
was
like
a
scene
out
of
christopher
isherwood
the
berlin
stories
all
these
blonde
boys
about
ten
of
us
running
around
doing
push
ups
so
that
our
muscles
would
swell
and
in
and
out
of
the
pool
and
a
big
buffet
and
everything
waiting
for
the
light
to
change
and
uh
so
i
get
my
picture
taken
by
bruce
weber
wonderful
guy
very
talented
obviously
and
he
wanted
me
to
uh
drop
my
shorts
and
i
felt
embarrassed
i
didn't
think
i
could
do
that
and
so
i
anyways
i
hid
everything
i
i
wasn't
able
to
expose
myself
so
anyways
he
took
these
pictures
of
me
and
i
have
one
and
i'll
uh
i'm
going
to
pass
it
out
as
a
sort
of
gift
for
you
uh
i
only
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
so
if
one
per
table
but
this
is
the
bruce
weber
picture
of
me
and
uh
i
was
the
uh
anyway
the
physique
was
looking
good
then
and
you
could
see
i
had
hair
it's
sort
of
depressing
to
look
at
that
now
i
don't
know
what
happened
but
uh
anyway
so
i
ended
up
in
the
whitney
biennial
i
like
to
say
to
my
artist
friends
uh
i've
been
in
the
biennial
but
it
was
in
this
picture
and
uh
in
the
back
of
this
is
the
thing
from
my
uh
nursery
school
just
so
you
can
study
that
if
you
like
so
so
pass
those
around
so
maybe
one
per
table
since
there's
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
but
so
it
can
get
to
the
back
alright
so
here
i
am
a
model
and
i
got
several
jobs
and
but
at
that
photo
shoot
at
at
bruce
weber's
farmhouse
i
met
a
very
pretty
girl
she
was
his
assistant
and
she
gave
me
her
phone
number
so
about
a
week
later
i'm
doing
my
modeling
appointments
which
are
called
go
sees
which
was
made
very
simple
for
the
models
it
was
go
see
someone
and
so
this
was
what
they
called
appoi
uh
appointments
were
go
sees
so
i'm
on
a
day
of
go
sees
and
i
found
myself
in
the
west
village
and
uh
right
by
cornelia
street
and
i
remembered
that
that
girl
lived
on
cornelia
street
and
i
my
high
school
love
was
a
girl
named
cornelia
and
so
suddenly
it
was
all
fusing
in
my
mind
so
i
call
her
and
uh
i
get
her
roommate
and
i
explain
that
i'm
in
the
neighborhood
and
is
i
won't
say
her
name
well
i'll
say
her
name
cause
i
can't
think
of
a
new
one
i'll
i
said
is
erin
home
no
and
i'm
her
roommate
and
i
said
oh
i'm
right
in
the
neighborhood
she
said
well
if
you
wanna
come
up
and
wait
for
her
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
she
should
be
home
soon
i
go
ok
so
i
go
up
to
her
apartment
and
i
meet
the
roommate
who
was
about
thirty
years
old
and
very
beautiful
and
very
exotic
to
me
at
you
know
i
was
twenty
she
was
thirty
and
uh
she
offers
me
a
glass
of
wine
we
end
up
drinking
uh
two
bottles
of
wine
not
not
only
is
my
life
been
shaped
by
uh
jobs
but
also
by
uh
liquor
and
sex
which
should
appeal
to
the
glenfiddich
people
so
um
so
we
drink
some
wine
we
drink
like
two
bottles
of
wine
the
first
girl
never
comes
home
and
i
end
up
making
love
to
the
roommate
which
these
things
happened
back
then
and
uh
so
we're
making
love
and
she
was
older
and
this
was
all
very
intriguing
to
me
and
at
a
penultimate
moment
the
moment
before
an
ultimate
moment
i
said
to
her
i
said
can
i
have
an
ultimate
moment
i
cause
i
wasn't
using
a
condom
this
was
sort
of
before
the
whole
condom
hysteria
and
aids
hysteria
and
so
everything
was
more
about
birth
control
not
you
know
i
i
thought
of
a
bad
line
earlier
death
control
so
this
was
all
about
birth
control
and
so
i
said
um
can
i
have
an
ultimate
moment
and
she
said
of
course
you
can
in
a
very
sort
of
condescending
way
which
was
a
bad
thing
to
hear
right
at
a
penultimate
moment
because
i
don't
know
it
de
destroyed
my
confidence
as
a
young
lover
i
thought
oh
of
course
you
can
why
didn't
i
know
that
and
so
uh
it
wrecked
my
ultimate
moment
a
little
some
short
circuiting 
happening
but
it
happened
and
so
i
thought
i
learned
a
valuable
lesson
which
is
you
never
ask
a
woman
if
you
can
have
your
ultimate
moment
you
just
go
ahead
and
have
it
you
don't
ask
her
unless
she
tells
you
beforehand
that
you
know
you
need
to
be
careful
or
something
so
i
thought
this
was
the
valuable
lesson
i
learned
to
be
a
lothario
never
ask
so
i
go
off
to
europe
to
be
a
model
because
i've
done
very
well
i
ended
up
being
photographed
by
this
guy
named
horst
and
i
was
in
bus
stop
adds
all
over
new
york
and
fernando
sanchez
lingerie
in
a
pair
of
bikinis
or
something
so
i
go
off
to
europe
to
milan
to
be
a
model
but
i
travel
for
about
a
month
and
a
half
and
i
get
in
a
terrible
bar
fight
in
paris
france
and
i
get
my
nose
broken
and
my
lips
split
and
my
skull
kneed
and
everything
got
really
beat
up
and
i
was
supposed
to
report
to
milan
milano
whatever
five
days
later
but
my
nose
was
all
purple
and
i
thought
you
know
what
i
wanted
to
be
a
writer
i
thought
a
writer
shouldn't
be
a
model
so
i'm
not
going
to
go
to
milano
and
that's
not
a
dignified
job
so
i
became
a
male
au
pair
in
paris
in
the
uh
montparnasse
neighborhood
so
i
uh
so
that
was
kind
of
a
good
job
because
that
was
right
near
where
hemingway
would
hang
out
and
even
pass
through
the
bakery
that
he
used
to
pass
through
to
get
to
gertrude
stein
and
so
i
had
my
two
little
charges
i
think
they
were
like
six
and
three
and
uh
and
it
was
wonderful
and
i
was
the
only
au
pair
garcon
in
the
whole
quarter
so
i
was
with
all
these
swedish
and
german
girls
and
it
was
even
better
than
being
a
model
and
going
to
cornelia
street
so
i
did
that
for
five
or
so
blissful
months
and
then
i
come
back
to
the
states
and
it's
late
spring
and
i
go
visit
some
friends
at
princeton
and
yet
again
i
get
completely
drunk
and
in
the
next
morning
i'm
lying
on
the
floor
of
my
friends'
dorm
room
and
i'm
totally
drunk
and
destroyed
and
debauched
and
ah
oh
and
i'm
lying
on
the
hard
floor
and
the
school
newspaper
comes
flying
underneath
the
door
there
was
like
a
bit
of
an
inch
comes
flying
under
the
door
and
opens
up
to
a
page
to
the
classifieds
as
it
sort
of
wafted
across
the
room
and
it
was
right
in
front
of
me
and
i
looked
down
and
there
was
an
advertisement
saying
come
spend
the
summer
in
new
hampshire
at
camp
thoreau
on
an
idyllic
lake
and
i
thought
this
is
what
i
need
i
need
to
stop
drinking
i'm
only
twenty
one
but
i
already
want
to
stop
drinking
i'm
sorry
glenfiddich
people
and
uh
let
me
go
off
to
new
hampshire
to
camp
thoreau
that's
what
i
need
to
do
so
i
go
off
to
camp
thoreau
and
i
got
the
job
because
i'd
been
an
au
pair
so
i
knew
how
to
deal
with
children
i'd
been
a
camp
counselor
during
the
summers
in
new
jersey
at
a
day
camp
so
i
get
the
job
i
go
off
to
camp
thoreau
and
i'm
doing
pretty
well
and
then
a
friend
of
mine
sends
me
lolita
which
i
had
never
read
before
which
is
not
the
best
sort
of
reading
material
when
there's
like
twelve
and
thirteen
year
old
girls
running
around
and
completely
distracted
me
in
the
wrong
way
and
uh
so
one
night
i
got
very
drunk
as
always
and
ate
a
some
food
and
the
whole
next
day
i
was
hung
over
for
the
whole
day
had
a
terrible
headache
into
the
night
and
i
was
sort
of
walking
around
the
the
camp
you
know
trying
to
clear
my
head
of
this
headache
that
had
lasted
all
day
and
i
see
a
light
on
at
the
uh
art
counselor's
uh
cabin
and
so
i
go
to
see
her
and
she's
in
her
she
was
thirty
four
and
i
said
do
you
have
an
aspirin
and
she
you
know
gets
me
an
aspirin
and
i
had
admired
her
down
by
the
lake
cause
i
had
noticed
that
you
could
see
some
pubis
sticking
out
from
the
sides
and
i
thought
this
was
a
more
appropriate
target
for
my
affections
than
these
young
girls
than
that
that
nabokov
influence
so
she
gets
me
an
aspirin
and
we're
sort
of
chatting
and
right
in
that
moment
a
bat
flies
right
between
us
and
we
both
scream
you
know
out
in
the
woods
there
in
new
hampshire
and
i
say
well
maybe
if
we
and
it's
flying
around
i
say
maybe
if
we
turn
the
lights
off
i
think
blats
are
bl
uh
bats
are
blind
but
if
we
turn
the
lights
off
it'll
see
i
don't
know
what
my
reasoning
was
so
i
turn
the
lights
off
and
we
wait
i
turn
the
lights
back
on
no
bat
and
i
felt
very
much
you
know
oh
i
really
am
a
woodsman
a
very
much
a
camp
thoreau
fellow
and
right
at
that
moment
of
hubris
as
always
the
bat
flies
right
between
us
like
some
sort
of
mad
cupid
goes
right
between
us
and
uh
and
i
turn
the
lights
off
again
i
put
my
arm
around
her
and
one
touch
leads
to
another
i
think
blake
has
a
poem
about
that
so
anyway
uh
we
end
up
in
bed
and
i
remember
the
rule
that
i
had
learned
the
year
before
with
with
another
older
woman
do
not
ask
if
you
can
have
an
ultimate
moment
just
go
ahead
and
when
you're
ready
have
your
ultimate
moment
you
know
appropriately
perhaps
after
she
may
have
had
one
but
i
don't
know
if
i
knew
that
at
twenty
one
so
i
had
i
had
two
ultimate
moments
that
night
it
was
quite
lovely
and
uh
but
the
next
day
it
turned
out
i
was
terribly
ill
and
i
ended
up
having
salmonella
poisoning
because
i
had
been
drinking
the
you
know
the
night
before
in
some
bar
and
ate
something
off
the
floor
who
knows
what
but
um
so
i
had
salmonella
poisoning
ended
up
in
dartmouth
hospital
and
uh
the
camp
year
came
to
an
end
i
never
made
love
with
the
art
counselor
again
but
i
you
know
we
parted
amicably
it
was
very
sweet
and
i
go
back
to
princeton
become
a
conscientious
objector
i
just
i
sold
a
novel
after
senior
year
i
moved
to
new
york
to
work
on
this
novel
and
i
get
a
letter
from
far
away
uh
in
the
united
states
and
i
open
it
up
and
it
turns
out
it's
a
letter
from
the
art
counselor
and
with
the
letter
is
a
picture
of
a
fifteen
month
old
baby
boy
with
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
i'm
told
that
it's
my
son
and
nine
months
of
pregnancy
fifteen
months
of
his
life
it
was
exactly
two
years
ago
and
i
was
like
oh
my
god
and
he
looked
exactly
like
i
did
so
sure
enough
this
moment
that
had
begun
on
cornelia
street
and
of
course
you
can
and
then
you
know
and
then
being
an
au
pair
and
getting
a
camp
job
and
all
this
drinking
had
led
to
me
looking
at
a
a
child
and
i
was
twenty
three
now
and
so
i
went
to
where
uh
they
lived
and
i
became
his
dad
and
uh
it
turned
out
you
know
all
this
au
pair
and
counseling
had
been
wonderful
training
and
uh
i
don't
mean
to
be
sentimental
but
that's
why
we
have
the
word
cause
sometimes
it
happens
so
i
became
his
dad
and
um
and
i
have
to
say
it's
the
best
job
i've
ever
had
and
my
son
is
now
seventeen
he
comes
up
in
two
days
to
be
with
me
for
ten
days
and
i
see
him
about
every
eight
weeks
and
he's
a
beautiful
boy
and
we've
had
an
incredible
father
son
thing
for
fifteen
years
now
so
that's
my
story
and
and
it
all
began
with
these
jobs
and
somehow
ended
up
there
rather
beautifully
so
i'll
do
a
hairy
call
