
i've
always
been
an
adrenaline
junkie
i
love
driving
fast
in
my
car
i
love
zipping
through
the
woods
in
my
my
snowboard
my
skis
and
i
really
love
backflipping
my
bmx
bike
but
what
i
hadn't
really
experienced
was
flight
it
was
something
that
i
had
always
been
interested
in
but
hadn't
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
and
specifically
helicopter
flight
i
always
thought
that
was
the
most
awesome
craft
to
pilot
being
quick
and
light
and
nimble
and
when
i
saw
an
ad
in
the
westford
paper
announcing
an
introductory
offer
for
thirty
minutes
of
sightseeing
and
thirty
minutes
of
instructional
time
i
felt
like
it
was
speaking
directly
to
me
so
i
called
them
up
immediately
and
set
my
appointment
and
for
the
next
few
days
i
was
extremely
excited
for
that
day
so
when
the
day
came
i
got
to
the
office
early
i'm
never
early
for
anything
but
i
was
early
on
this
day
and
i'm
walking
into
the
office
and
i
look
over
and
i
see
a
motorcycle
in
the
shadows
this
really
cool
looking
motorcycle
and
i
remember
thinking
these
are
my
people
so
i
go
in
i
sign
my
name
i
go
out
with
the
pilot
we
look
at
the
helicopter
we
get
inside
butterflies
are
going
i
am
so
pumped
it's
time
i'm
gonna
fly
this
thing
i
got
my
own
set
of
controls
he
has
his
own
set
of
controls
we
got
our
little
lap
belts
on
get
our
headsets
on
and
then
the
pilot
points
over
at
this
fire
exting
fire
extinguisher
and
he
says
i
need
you
to
promise
me
something
and
i'm
gonna
promise
you
something
too
if
you
are
on
fire
i
promise
i
will
put
you
out
okay
so
i
say
back
to
him
if
you
are
on
fire
i
promise
i'll
put
you
out
he
gives
me
a
high
five
we
started
up
the
main
rotor
blade
starts
spinning
and
we
just
lift
off
the
ground
he
just
takes
us
right
up
and
it's
got
a
glass
floor
i'm
looking
at
it
and
it's
it's
like
jumping
my
bike
but
never
coming
down
we
just
continue
to
go
up
and
up
and
i
am
so
stoked
we're
flying
around
and
you
wouldn't
believe
just
out
past
the
dirt
roads
it
is
like
an
african
savannah
a
safari
you
just
see
things
that
you
would
never
see
or
realize
are
just
out
there
past
the
city
we
get
up
and
i
see
this
herd
of
deer
and
it's
so
beautiful
they're
like
running
cause
they
hear
the
helicopter
and
they're
in
a
big
pack
and
they're
looking
over
their
shoulders
and
we're
flying
above
them
and
i'm
just
like
how
cool
is
this
nobody
would
ever
get
to
see
this
and
so
then
he
zips
into
this
little
this
empty
river
bed
and
then
just
starts
gunning
it
through
this
river
bed
like
fifteen
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
and
i'm
loving
it
there's
trees
on
either
side
of
us
and
we're
just
zipping
winding
through
it
and
i'm
just
like
this
is
so
cool
i
i
say
to
him
dude
you
need
to
get
an
awesome
stereo
system
in
this
thing
man
you
could
just
rock
out
and
he
looks
over
at
me
and
all
like
yeah
yeah
this
is
good
right
and
i'm
just
envisioning
this
i'm
having
this
whole
fantasy
in
my
head
i'm
like
i'm
gonna
get
one
of
these
some
day
i'm
gonna
have
my
own
helicopter
i'm
gonna
tint
the
windows
i'm
gonna
paint
it
like
a
dragonfly
i'm
gonna
put
a
sweet
stereo
system
in
this
thing
people
are
gonna
be
looking
up
in
the
air
like
hey
there's
brian
look
at
him
so
i'm
just
in
this
fantasy
world
just
so
stoked
we're
just
hauling
ass
around
i
love
it
and
then
he
comes
up
out
of
there
and
he
says
alright
play
time's
over
business
time
time
for
you
to
learn
a
little
bit
anybody
that's
gonna
be
a
real
pilot
needs
to
know
this
it's
an
emergency
drill
it's
in
our
rotation
basically
i'm
gonna
cut
the
power
it's
like
putting
your
car
into
neutral
going
downhill
main
rotor
blades
gonna
keep
spinning
but
there's
gonna
be
a
big
drop
in
altitude
at
the
beginning
you
like
elitches
rides
and
you
know
rollercoasters
that
kind
of
stuff
you
got
a
soft
stomach
or
are
you
pretty
tough
i'm
like
i'm
i'm
good
with
that
i'm
i'm
cool
he's
okay
okay
cool
cause
if
you
have
a
problem
just
let
me
know
i'll
land
and
you
can
hurl
okay
cool
bases
are
covered
let's
do
this
so
sure
enough
he
kills
the
power
whoo
we
get
that
like
thirty
foot
drop
just
instantly
in
altitude
i
feel
the
dr
upward
draft
of
the
the
air
and
we
just
kinda
come
into
like
this
soft
slow
drift
and
i'm
getting
a
feel
what
he's
saying
you
can
do
if
you
have
an
emergency
uh
landing
situation
then
i
start
looking
at
him
he's
fidgeting
with
stuff
he's
turning
things
he's
got
a
stressed
look
on
his
face
i'm
just
like
everything
alright
he
looks
at
me
with
wild
eyes
like
this
the
real
thing
man
i
i
i
can't
believe
it
i
look
out
i
look
down
it's
like
a
model
railroad
set
these
tiny
little
trees
and
my
first
thought
is
we're
gonna
die
we
are
going
to
die
i
i
signed
up
for
this
i
paid
money
to
die
like
you've
you've
gotta
be
kidding
me
a
and
i'm
just
watching
and
we're
slowly
starting
to
fall
towards
the
earth
and
i
cannot
believe
this
is
happening
i'm
just
like
this
is
a
bad
joke
right
like
when's
the
cameras
gonna
come
out
and
he's
gonna
smile
and
say
just
kidding
but
he
doesn't
he's
just
doing
like
s
turns
and
figure
eights
and
i'm
just
thinking
i
i
didn't
i
didn't
i
never
expected
that
this
would
be
my
last
day
and
i
start
having
these
crazy
thoughts
like
i
put
in
some
pictures
to
get
developed
who's
gonna
ever
see
those
who's
gonna
get
my
car
like
it's
parked
down
there
and
who
you
know
i'm
just
i
i
can't
believe
that
this
is
the
day
we're
gonna
die
there's
just
no
other
way
around
it
this
you
don't
walk
away
from
a
helicopter
crash
and
so
he
starts
he
starts
looking
like
he
may
be
able
to
land
this
thing
we're
coming
down
towards
the
ground
and
and
i
now
my
my
mind
starts
to
shift
from
were
gonna
die
to
we're
gonna
get
really
warped
we're
gonna
hit
the
ground
and
it's
gonna
suck
i'm
gonna
be
laying
there
with
a
broken
back
like
i
just
it's
like
i
wear
more
pads
when
i'm
riding
my
bike
i've
got
a
helmet
and
knee
pads
i've
got
a
little
lap
belt
and
this
little
headset
and
we're
in
like
a
glass
box
i'm
just
like
we're
definitely
gonna
get
warped
so
admit
it
to
yourself
the
next
hour's
gonna
really
suck
you
know
and
so
here
we
go
we're
coming
in
for
a
landing
we're
coming
in
about
a
ten
twelve
degree
angle
he's
doing
good
he's
got
us
going
about
fifty
miles
an
hour
straight
towards
the
ground
and
he
just
yells
to
me
he's
like
we're
gonna
hit
and
and
i
just
did
the
only
thing
i
thought
seemed
right
i
just
shut
my
eyes
i
took
a
deep
breath
i
put
my
arms
out
in
front
of
my
face
and
sure
enough
we
hit
the
ground
and
we
just
four
by
four
across
the
prairie
just
like
you
know
bouncing
across
the
the
the
the
gopher
holes
and
then
the
left
skid
digs
into
the
ground
and
it
makes
us
stop
instantly
and
we
just
jerk
forward
and
then
the
main
rotor
blade
is
just
going
super
fast
it
hits
the
ground
and
it
just
cartwheels
the
whole
helicopter
and
it
smashes
and
breaks
it
right
off
behind
our
heads
and
we
come
to
a
stop
looking
at
the
sky
and
there's
just
smoke
and
i
can
smell
jet
fuel
and
the
flight
manuals
are
all
scattered
around
inside
the
the
cockpit
and
i
just
shoulder
the
door
and
jump
out
and
my
feet
touch
the
ground
and
i
just
can't
believe
it
i'm
just
like
yes
and
i
look
up
and
i'm
just
like
oh
my
god
we
were
just
up
that
high
and
now
we're
here
and
i
have
just
like
a
tiny
cut
on
my
pinkie
it's
like
and
i'm
just
astounded
that
this
has
just
happened
and
then
i
look
at
the
pilot
and
he
comes
around
the
corner
from
his
side
and
he's
just
like
i
am
so
sorry
dude
i
am
so
sorry
and
i'm
just
like
thank
you
you
did
it
you
landed
it
and
he's
like
i
am
so
sorry
brian
and
i'm
like
thank
you
and
it
goes
on
and
on
like
this
and
i'm
just
i'm
beside
myself
i
cannot
believe
it
i'm
like
i'm
fine
and
then
he
just
i
he
turns
into
a
stress
case
his
hands
are
his
head's
in
his
hands
he's
just
like
oh
my
god
i
am
so
dead
faa's
gonna
have
to
make
a
full
investigation
there's
a
nine
thousand
dollar
deductible
we
just
rebuilt
the
thing
oh
god
we
gotta
go
find
help
let's
go
so
off
we
go
we
just
go
walking
across
the
prairie
and
i'm
just
like

a
pie
in
the
sky
just
like
oh
wow
this
is
crazy
wait
till
i
tell
my
friends
about
this
one
and
he's
stressed
the
whole
walk
and
then
we
see
a
truck
come
rumbling
down
the
dirt
road
we're
like
hey
we
wave
down
this
truck
we
hop
over
the
the
uh
the
fence
we
flag
these
guys
down
they've
got
a
cb
in
their
truck
they
call
the
paramedics
the
cops
literally
within
minutes
it's
like
every
single
emergency
vehicle
within
a
tri
stat
tri
state
region
is
coming
over
the
hill
ambulances
firetrucks
cops
four
wheelers
everybody
wants
to
see
what's
going
on
a
helicopter
crash
and
people
lived
what
so
it's
crazy
you
know
the
the
paramedics
insist
that
i'm
in
shock
and
i'm
injured
i
had
to
have
gotten
hurt
i'm
just
not
feeling
it
yet
even
though
i've
walked
miles
to
get
here
i'm
like
i'm
fine
you
know
i
i
crash
on
a
regular
basis
on
my
bike
i'm
i'm
good
i
know
when
i'm
hurt
but
they
insist
on
taking
me
to
the
hospital
and
checking
me
out
and
giving
me
an
iv
of
saline
and
so
i'm
laying
there
and
i
get
interviewed
by
the
news
and
my
phone
is
blowing
up
and
it's
just
an
insane
day
and
i
can't
believe
it
i'm
like
it's
a
dream
and
i
just
go
home
and
i'm
i'm
just
like
what
and
i'm
laying
in
bed
that
night
and
i
just
i'm
laying
on
my
back
my
head's
on
my
pillow
and
i
shut
my
eyes
and
i
still
feel
like
i'm
falling
i
still
feel
like
i'm
slowly
drifting
to
the
earth
and
i'm
like
you
know
i
i
think
i'm
gonna
still
live
boldly
i'm
gonna
still
go
fast
in
my
car
i'mma
still
jump
my
bike
and
do
crazy
stuff
but
i
don't
think
i
need
to
learn
how
to
fly
a
helicopter
thank
you
