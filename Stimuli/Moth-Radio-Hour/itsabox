
so
i'm
standing
in
the
phone
box
and
i
put
twenty
pence
in
and
i
phone
my
boyfriend
and
he
answers
so
i
put
a
pound
coin
in
and
just
as
we're
about
to
speak
i
suddenly
feel
the
door
behind
me
open
a
hand
appears
out
of
nowhere
and
i
watch
it
press
down
the
switchhook
of
the
phone
i
hear
the
pound
coin
drop
to
the
bottom
and
i
watch
this
hand
remove
the
coin
earlier
that
evening
i
had
actually
been
staying
at
my
boyfriend's
flat
he
lived
on
main
university
campus
in
birmingham
city
center
he
was
away
on
work
experience
and
he'd
given
me
the
keys
to
his
flat
which
was
great
for
me
because
i
lived
off
main
campus
a
another
site
in
handsworth
word
a
short
bus
ride
away
but
after
spending
a
few
nights
there
and
a
really
long
day
in
the
library
i
suddenly
had
this
urge
that
i
needed
to
go
home
i
just
needed
to
be
in
my
own
space
i
needed
fresh
clothes
i
wanted
to
sleep
in
my
own
bed
and
i
really
missed
my
flatmates
but
as
soon
as
i
thought
it
a
voice
in
my
head
said
don't
go
but
i
want
to
go
and
again
the
voice
said
don't
go
now
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
wasn't
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
voice
it
made
me
quite
anxious
but
i
couldn't
quite
figure
out
what
it
meant
or
what
could
possibly
happen
and
i
had
to
think
about
it
for
a
while
and
eventually
i
decided
no
i'm
gonna
go
home
but
to
appease
this
voice
in
my
head
i
decided
to
remove
my
jewelry
my
watch
leave
my
cards
behind
and
my
cash
but
just
take
enough
money
for
my
bus
fare
there
and
to
return
the
following
morning
and
enough
also
to
phone
my
boyfriend
from
the
pay
phone
on
campus
and
so
i
set
off
and
it
was
probably
about
i
don't
know
eight
thirty
in
the
evening
so
i
was
studying
in
birmingham
and
it
their
subways
particularly
when
i
was
there
had
a
reputation
for
being
quite
seedy
and
unsafe
and
i
had
actually
been
flashed
at
a
number
of
times
down
there
but
on
this
particular
occasion
as
i
walked
through
the
tunnel
i
noticed
a
female
police
officer
ahead
of
me
and
i
remember
thinking
this
was
a
good
omen
i
kind
of
broke
my
stride
so
we
were
almost
walking
in
tandem
without
making
it
too
obvious
and
then
i
exit
the
subway
and
i
get
to
my
bus
stop
and
usually
regardless
of
what
the
timetable
says
i
always
have
to
wait
half
an
hour
for
my
bus
but
on
this
particular
evening
it
comes
within
minutes
so
i
when
i
get
on
the
bus
i
actually
sit
near
the
bus
driver
because
i
think
this
is
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
and
then
i
arrive
at
my
stop
and
at
this
point
i'd
say
i'm
pretty
much
on
the
home
stretch
all
i
have
to
do
now
is
get
home
and
as
i'm
walking
along
this
street
i
suddenly
notice
an
empty
phone
box
on
the
corner
and
in
that
moment
i
decide
i'm
gonna
call
my
boyfriend
from
there
now
i
make
this
decision
because
the
pay
phone
on
campus
serves
about
fifty
people
and
it's
always
ringing
off
the
hook
so
if
i
really
wanna
speak
to
my
boyfriend
tonight
this
is
my
best
chance
i
realize
at
this
point
i'm
slightly
deviating
from
the
plan
of
just
going
straight
home
but
i
can
distinctly
remember
as
i
felt
the
door
close
behind
me
i'm
safe
in
here
it's
a
box
so
i
put
my
money
in
and
i
call
my
boyfriend
and
then
suddenly
i
feel
the
door
behind
me
open
a
hand
appears
out
of
nowhere
and
i
watch
it
press
down
the
switchhook
of
the
phone
i
hear
the
pound
coin
drop
to
the
bottom
and
i
watch
this
hand
remove
the
coin
i
don't
remember
dropping
the
receiver
but
i
do
remember
seeing
it
swing
from
side
to
side
suddenly
these
arms
tighten
around
me
and
i
can
feel
something
sharp
against
my
neck
and
i'm
scared
i'm
so
scared
my
mouth
is
dry
and
i
can
hardly
breathe
and
my
heart
is
beating
so
fast
i
can
feel
it
pulsing
in
the
back
of
my
throat
like
at
any
moment
it
could
just
rip
through
and
i'm
fighting
so
hard
to
stop
my
knees
from
buckling
and
i
keep
saying
to
myself
over
and
over
again
is
this
happening
this
isn't
happening
is
this
really
happening
to
me
i
think
i'm
told
not
to
move
or
make
a
sound
but
i
can't
be
sure
he
asks
me
for
money
but
i
don't
have
any
no
wait
i
i
do
i
have
seventy
five
pence
i
think
he
thinks
i'm
mocking
him
so
i
give
him
my
bag
and
he
turns
me
around
and
he
pushes
me
up
against
the
phone
and
through
the
sheer
panic
of
it
all
something
happened
to
me
i
was
suddenly
overcome
by
this
strange
sense
of
calm
presence
and
lucidity
my
senses
were
heightened
and
i
could
feel
and
sense
everything
around
me
it
was
like
i
was
inhabiting
every
cell
of
my
body
and
i
think
time
must
have
stood
still
or
something
because
after
that
everything
happened
in
slow
motion
the
voice
in
my
head
asks
me
so
how
does
this
end
what
happens
now
and
so
i
start
running
through
all
these
different
scenarios
in
my
mind
or
maybe
i'm
stabbed
and
i
die
or
maybe
i'm
raped
stabbed
and
then
i
die
or
maybe
maybe
i'm
stabbed
but
i
go
into
intensive
care
but
then
i
slip
into
a
coma
and
then
i
die
and
the
voice
says
well
whatever
way
you
look
at
this
you
really
have
nothing
to
lose
but
if
you
do
survive
the
police
will
want
a
description
you
need
to
get
a
description
so
i
slowly
raise
my
hands
and
i
turn
around
to
face
him
and
i
tell
him
to
check
my
pockets
for
money
just
in
case
he
doesn't
believe
me
and
as
he
does
i
look
at
him
and
i
take
the
image
of
him
in
the
color
of
his
hair
his
eyes
his
clothing
his
height
and
the
stanley
knife
in
his
hand
he
looks
up
and
he
notices
the
tracking
movements
of
my
eyes
and
he
quickly
turns
me
around
and
he
forces
me
up
against
the
phone
his
hands
start
to
move
over
my
breasts
and
the
voice
says
don't
move
don't
even
flinch
let
him
touch
you
let
him
think
he
has
you
and
so
i
do
let
him
touch
me
and
for
a
brief
moment
i
can
almost
sense
a
slight
release
of
tension
in
his
arm
and
all
the
while
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
how
did
i
get
into
the
phone
box
which
way
did
the
door
open
what
side
of
the
door
was
the
handle
on
which
hand
did
i
use
meanwhile
his
hands
are
traveling
downwards
towards
my
groin
and
in
that
moment
i
decide
i'd
rather
die
i
grab
his
arms
and
i
use
my
weight
to
push
him
backwards
into
the
door
and
using
my
elbows
i
swing
to
the
right
so
that
as
i
swing
to
the
left
i
use
his
weight
to
leverage
the
door
open
and
the
door
opens
and
so
i
run
and
i'm
screaming
i
think
but
then
i
stop
running
because
i
realize
very
quickly
he's
not
chasing
me
he's
run
away
i
don't
know
what
it
was
in
that
moment
if
it
was
just
the
effects
of
the
adrenaline
but
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
find
him
so
that
i
could
stab
him
and
kill
him
but
as
i'm
looking
around
i
don't
see
anyone
apart
from
an
indian
man
standing
in
the
driveway
of
his
house
next
to
his
car
he
shouts
to
me
are
you
okay
course
i'm
not
okay
i've
just
been
mugged
which
way
did
he
go
i
start
running
down
a
dark
road
and
the
man
chases
me
and
brings
me
back
telling
me
it's
not
a
good
idea
he
walks
me
to
the
phone
box
where
i
pick
up
my
bag
and
i
replace
the
handset
and
the
phone
rings
and
so
for
some
bizarre
reason
i
answer
it
it's
my
boyfriend
he
tells
me
he's
been
trying
to
call
me
for
the
last
two
minutes
what
are
you
sure
i
hang
up
and
then
the
indian
man
offers
to
drive
me
home
i
tell
him
he's
crazy
i'm
not
getting
in
a
car
with
you
you're
a
stranger
you're
a
man
he
offers
to
bring
his
wife
along
so
that
i
feel
safe
it's
just
that
now
i
have
to
wait
for
her
because
she
has
to
get
ready
and
get
her
purse
so
as
i
stand
outside
the
door
waiting
for
her
every
single
member
of
the
family
appears
at
the
door
wanting
to
know
what
happened
wanting
to
come
along
for
the
ride
eventually
everyone
is
seated
in
the
car
everyone
except
for
me
there's
no
room
for
me
to
sit
someone
has
to
get
out
of
the
car
so
that
i
can
get
in
so
that
i
can
go
home
eventually
it's
agreed
that
the
grandfather
will
stay
behind
the
drive
is
excruciatingly
slow
owing
to
the
weight
of
the
car
and
so
claustrophobic
i
burst
into
tears
and
the
grandmother
says
stop
crying
what
are
you
crying
for
it's
not
like
you
were
raped
oh
wait
a
minute
she
says
he
didn't
touch
you
down
there
did
he
no
well
that's
alright
then
because
otherwise
you
would've
been
spoiled
we
get
to
the
car
park
and
i
ask
to
be
let
down
they
offer
to
walk
me
to
my
door
and
i
flat
out
refuse
and
as
i
watch
the
car
pull
away
{cg}
i
realize
as
i
stand
in
this
dark
car
park
i'm
breathing
again
and
it's
only
in
that
moment
i
realize
i'm
home
i
made
it
home
thank
you
