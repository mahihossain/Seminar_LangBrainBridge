so
i'm
sitting
in
my
shrink's
office
this
one
time
and
he
says
to
me
how's
it
going
and
i
say
well
to
be
honest
doc
i
had
a
really
really
horrible
experience
the
other
day
and
he
says
tell
me
about
it
and
i
say
well
it
all
started
when
i
was
i
was
laying
on
my
couch
and
he
looks
at
me
and
he
says
really
which
if
you
know
me
is
an
incredibly
funny
thing
for
him
to
say
because
i
i
have
probably
spent
more
time
lying
on
couches
than
any
able
bodied
man
under
the
age
of
say
a
hundred
and
ten
living
today
uh
if
lying
on
couches
was
a
martial
art
i
would
have
a
ninth
level
black
belt
ninja
master
status
in
it
um
i
uh
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
i
i
was
originally
asked
by
the
moth
to
do
this
event
and
they
explained
about
the
seven
deadly
sins
i
was
amazed
that
sloth
was
even
still
available
uh
i
i
i
assumed
that
sloth
would
be
the
first
sin
picked
because
it
is
really
the
central
thing
about
our
culture
isn't
it
it's
which
is
all
we
live
we
live
in
a
whole
society
based
on
consumer
entertainment
and
sort
of
luxury
effort
reduction
um
but
within
that
culture
my
own
generation
which
they
used
to
call
gen
x
or
slackers
really
distinguidich
distinguished
itself
even
among
you
know
the
the
the
general
culture
and
within
that
elite
group
of
of
underachievers
i
distinguish
myself
as
really
a
super
achiever
of
underachievement
um
if
if
sloth
is
a
sin
i
am
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
i
am
i'm
really
guilty
of
like
milosevic
level
crimes
against
humanity
and
um
and
if
if
the
if
the
vatican
conducted
its
affairs
the
way
that
governments
do
there
there
would
be
some
sort
of
secret
vatican
sniper
up
in
these
windows
ready
to
take
me
out
right
now
um
i
lived
for
years
and
years
and
years
in
uh
just
bumming
around
this
luh
wonderful
college
town
called
madison
wisconsin
and
um
do
people
know
madison
great
that's
fantastic
and
we
had
a
whole
culture
there
that
was
essentially
built
around
couches
um
everything
was
centered
around
the
living
room
because
what
your
life
consisted
of
was
every
second
that
you
weren't
slaving
away
at
your
shitty
mini
minimum
wage
job
and
that's
i'd
like
to
dispel
a
myth
about
slackers
right
now
which
is
that
they
don't
work
hard
because
in
order
to
live
this
life
of
sloth
you
really
have
to
work
like
a
slave
to
do
it
because
opting
out
of
the
career
rat
race
essentially
means
opting
into
the
working
poor
you
know
and
and
and
um
and
so
every
second
that
you
weren't
at
that
job
you
were
sitting
in
your
living
room
sitting
with
your
friends
you're
watching
tv
you're
smoking
pot
you're
listening
to
rock
and
roll
and
watching
dvds
and
but
but
but
mainly
just
engaging
in
conversation
and
you're
trying
to
wring
every
last
ounce
of
leisure
of
luxury
effort
reduction
out
of
the
remaining
hours
before
your
shift
at
the
job
you
hate
starts
again
um
we
had
a
wonderful
tradition
in
madison
because
every
year
the
s
when
the
students
would
move
the
frat
guys
would
leave
their
furniture
aba
abandoned
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
so
every
year
you
would
take
the
cigarette
hole
burned
beer
stained
vomit
smelling
couch
that
just
stank
like
weed
and
cigarettes
and
you
would
pick
it
up
and
you'd
march
it
out
of
the
house
and
you'd
set
it
down
and
then
you'd
go
get
a
brand
new
couch
from
the
frat
kids
and
you'd
move
it
into
the
empty
space
where
you
had
the
previous
couch
and
you'd
set
it
down
and
you'd
have
a
wonderful
new
couch
to
abuse
for
the
following
year
now
one
of
the
things
i
did
during
all
these
years
of
slacking
in
madison
was
i
was
writing
jokes
for
the
onion
and
to
my
great
surprise
that
eventually
turned
into
a
career
and
i
and
no
one
could've
been
more
surprised
about
it
than
me
believe
me
and
we
i
ended
up
moving
to
new
york
and
for
the
first
time
i
had
money
so
i
was
incredibly
excited
because
i
was
not
only
going
to
be
able
to
live
this
life
of
slack
but
i
was
gonna
be
able
to
live
it
in
style
and
i
set
up
this
wonder
i
got
this
a
wonderful
apartment
in
brooklyn
this
nice
living
room
and
i
s
filled
it
with
with
uh
seating
i
bought
a
s
i
bought
a
surround
sound
home
theater
and
i
got
a
dvd
player
for
it
i
got
a
big
tv
and
and
and
i
got
a
fantastic
number
for
great
connection
with
a
just
top
notch
weed
delivery
service
and
um
and
and
the
best
thing
is
i
bought
this
fantastic
it
was
the
couch
of
my
dreams
at
this
vintage
store
i
spent
five
hundred
dollars
on
it
only
couch
i
ever
spent
money
on
in
my
life
and
um
and
i
was
so
looking
forward
to
all
the
wonderful
times
i
was
gonna
to
have
with
all
of
these
great
new
friends
i
was
gonna
make
in
new
york
but
what
i
didn't
understand
was
that
new
york
is
not
like
madison
it's
not
a
living
room
based
town
because
all
of
the
you
know
lower
east
side
you
know
downtown
bohemians
that
i
was
wanting
to
hang
out
with
they
don't
have
living
rooms
they
they
they
have
a
box
with
a
bed
and
a
refrigerator
and
a
toilet
and
a
shower
and
a
sink
and
that's
what
that's
where
they
live
and
so
in
the
lieu
of
hanging
out
in
living
rooms
they
hang
out
in
bars
and
restaurants
now
and
and
and
for
that
reason
it's
also
not
a
marijuana
town
it's
an
alcohol
town
so
i've
had
to
learn
to
drink
and
i'm
i'm
getting
pretty
good
at
it
to
be
honest
but
um
but
uh
you
know
nuh
none
of
those
things
really
matter
if
like
me
you
live
in
brooklyn
but
people
from
manhattan
won't
go
to
brooklyn
because
it's
a
twenty
minute
ride
on
the
train
and
they're
busy
spending
forty
to
eighty
minutes
waiting
to
get
into
the
cool
restaurant
or
bar
so
the
upshot
of
all
this
is
i
spend
about
the
next
five
years
of
my
life
in
the
ultimate
slack
pad
i've
created
surrounded
by
empty
seats
alone
playing
video
games
watching
dvds
by
myself
surrounded
by
empty
seating
and
what's
worse
is
the
is
is
that
my
my
dvd
player
even
mocks
me
because
whenever
you
hit
stop
a
screen
saver
comes
on
with
their
consumer
entertainment
you
know
home
theater
slogan
that
says
everyone's
invited
everyone's
invited
every
day
everyone's
invited
but
you're
here
by
yourself
aren't
you
over
the
years
the
combined
effects
of
a
gravity
b
time
and
c
my
ass
on
this
couch
literally
destroy
my
dream
couch
the
part
of
the
couch
where
my
ass
is
centered
has
collapsed
completely
there's
like
there's
like
springs
and
metal
falling
out
the
bottom
stuffing
is
falling
out
the
bottom
i
have
to
it's
ch
it's
there's
just
a
hole
where
my
ass
is
i
have
to
i
have
to
fill
it
up
with
pillows
and
and
blankets
and
put
a
board
over
it
just
to
continue
to
lay
on
it
now
at
this
point
in
the
story
i'm
sure
that
those
of
you
in
the
audience
with
even
a
remote
sense
of
insight
into
the
human
condition
are
probably
thinking
to
yourself
well
you
know
these
stories
are
all
kinda
cute
anecdotes
and
they're
a
little
bit
funny
but
i
have
another
interpretation
of
everything
this
man
on
stage
is
saying
and
it
sounds
kinda
to
me
like
he's
describing
the
behavior
of
someone
who
is
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
clinically
depressed
and
you
would
be
right
i
i
happen
to
have
been
clinically
depressed
pretty
much
my
entire
adult
life
which
brings
us
back
to
why
i
was
sitting
in
my
shrink's
office
in
the
first
place
telling
him
about
this
horrible
experience
so
he
says
tell
me
about
it
i
say
i'm
laying
on
the
couch
and
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
you've
run
out
of
all
the
distractions
available
in
the
living
room
like
i
had
watched
all
the
dvds
i
had
finished
all
the
video
games
i
had
masturbated
to
all
of
the
available
pornography
uh
the
i
smoked
all
the
drugs
there
was
nothing
left
and
i
had
a
moment
of
s
zen
stillness
and
clarity
where
i
was
face
to
face
with
myself
and
i
looked
in
myself
and
i
saw
this
horrific
nightmarish
void
of
nothingness
it
was
just
this
swirling
vortex
of
empty
zero
there
was
nothing
there
i
felt
like
i
had
no
future
no
past
no
options
no
hope
like
there
was
nothing
to
believe
in
and
at
this
point
my
shrink
cuts
me
off
and
he
says
todd
todd
wait
wait
hold
on
right
now
i'm
hearing
a
lot
of
negativity
from
you
i
mean
you're
just
describing
a
a
horrible
descent
into
nihilism
and
i
give
him
this
look
like
well
duh
you
know
and
i
say
yeah
the
reason
you're
hearing
that
is
cause
that's
what
i'm
telling
you
and
he
says
well
todd
but
that's
very
serious
nihilism
is
a
terrible
place
to
end
up
bad
things
happen
to
people
that
go
there
you
can
drown
in
that
shit
so
i
say
well
let
me
tell
you
do
i
hear
a
cell
phone
is
that
what
that
is
so
i
tell
him
maybe
someone's
just
giving
me
a
little
hip
hop
background
to
this
so
eh
i
tell
him
well
let
me
finish
the
story
have
you
ever
been
so
depressed
that
you
just
can't
get
out
of
bed
or
you
just
can't
get
out
of
your
chair
and
you
just
end
up
relying
on
whatever's
in
arm's
reach
of
you
you
know
and
so
i'm
sort
of
groping
around
the
couch
just
for
a
just
looking
for
something
anything
to
distract
me
from
this
horrible
emptiness
that
i'm
experiencing
and
i
reach
under
the
couch
and
i
find
this
old
paperback
book
that
has
been
kicked
under
there
probably
a
couple
of
months
earlier
and
i
pull
it
out
and
it's
the
ultimate
perfect
book
for
lifting
someone
out
of
their
own
personal
hell

happens
to
be
swear
to
god
this
is
true
not
making
this
up
dante's
inferno
so
so
i'm
like
i
obviously
cannot
handle
reading
dante's
inferno
right
now
but
lacking
anything
else
to
do
i
decide
i'm
gonna
read
the
foreword
so
the
foreword
is
written
by
some
scholar
of
medieval
italian
epic
poetry
or
whatever
and
i
start
reading
it
and
i
say
to
my
doc
as
as
reading
it
i
learned
a
new
word
he
says
what
was
it
and
i
said
well
the
word
is
acedia
i'd
never
heard
of
this
word
before
he
says
what
does
it
mean
i
said
well
it
was
the
medieval
catholic's
word
for
the
profound
sense
of
emptiness
that
comes
from
not
believing
in
anything
they
saw
it
as
a
sin
uh
and
s
specifically
uh
the
sin
of
the
failure
they
defined
it
as
the
failure
to
pursue
god
in
other
words
a
a
lack
of
making
the
effort
necessary
to
seek
out
the
joy
of
god
or
more
generally
of
of
creation
and
it
was
considered
so
dangerous
that
they
actually
numbered
it
among
the
seven
deadly
sins
acedia
and
i
by
the
way
i
don't
know
if
it's
actually
pronounced
acedia
because
i'm
a
college
dropout
i
don't
know
how
to
pronounce
ancient
latin
granted
i
knew
i
was
gonna
be
speaking
in
front
of
a
couple
hundred
people
i
probably
could've
googled
it
and
figured
out
the
pronunciation
but
i
was
too
lazy
so
um
and
at
this
point
i
can
tell
you
know
i
can
tell
that
that
my
shrink
is
is
is
a
little
uncomfortable
with
how
the
conversation's
going
because
he
doesn't
like
talking
about
sin
he
doesn't
like
sin
doctrine
based
modes
of
behavioral
modification
because
he's
a
shrink
and
shrinks
are
always
against
thinking
about
things
in
terms
of
sin
because
sin
is
always
about
guilt
and
a
shrink's
job
is
to
get
people
to
get
over
guilt
so
he's
kinda
trying
to
change
the
subject
but
what
i
say
to
him
is
the
amazing
thing
about
this
is
that
in
modern
times
it's
usually
translated
or
mistranslated
if
you
will
as
sloth
because
it
involves
a
a
lack
of
effort
but
the
idea
is
you
know
when
when
when
we
hear
sloth
now
i
mean
you
it
just
seems
like
laziness
it's
not
that
big
of
a
sin
it's
not
deadly
but
they
but
they
were
talking
about
something
far
more
serious
they
were
talking
about
a
deep
existential
despair
thanks
and
and
i
realized
as
i
was
talking
to
them
that
if
i'm
guilty
of
acedia
then
so
is
our
whole
consumer
entertainment
prozac
taking
depressed
out
of
their
mind
nation
and
i
figured
there's
two
ways
of
looking
at
it
either
we
should
be
very
grateful
that
ancient
catholic
doctrine
doesn't
still
dominate
the
intellectual
world
because
if
so
then
me
and
the
whole
nation
are
all
just
guilty
unredeemable
sinners
and
can
be
written
off
but
the
second
way
of
looking
at
it
that's
perhaps
a
little
more
productive
is
that
this
was
a
way
of
looking
at
my
depression
that
didn't
involve
me
being
a
helpless
victim
of
a
sickness
defined
by
a
condition
and
that
i
might
have
some
degree
of
of
personal
responsibility
for
my
own
state
of
mind
so
my
shrink
looks
at
me
and
he
doesn't
say
anything
for
a
very
long
time
because
he
doesn't
like
how
the
conversation's
going
but
on
the
other
hand
he's
a
smart
guy
so
he's
thinking
very
very
intently
and
finally
he
looks
up
at
me
and
he
says
that's
very
interesting
what
are
you
gonna
do
about
it
and
i
look
back
at
him
and
i
say
hmmmmmm
thank
you
