so
it
starts
in
nineteen
eighty
nine
and
it's
july
and
i'm
on
tour
with
my
band
and
we're
touring
through
europe
and
this
is
a
very
usual
thing
i
had
been
touring
for
years
and
years
seven
or
eight
years
by
that
point
so
um
it
we
had
just
come
from
israel
and
we
had
landed
in
the
uk
in
england
so
i
had
never
been
to
israel
before
and
the
first
time
you
go
there
all
the
security
is
a
bit
daunting
you
know
they
search
you
and
they
search
you
again
and
they
ask
you
questions
and
i
found
it
a
little
scary
so
um
even
though
i
really
enjoyed
my
time
there
i
was
looking
forward
to
coming
back
to
england
which
was
very
familiar
to
me
so
this
was
we
had
just
landed
in
england
we
were
staying
at
the
holiday
inn
airport
uh
near
heathrow
very
glamorous
{ls} 
so
um
i
wake
up
that
morning
and
um
that
night
i'm
going
to
play
at
the
glastonbury
festival
in
glastonbury
so
we
have
a
a
a
a
journey
to
go
to
and
it's
probably
going
to
be
the
biggest
audience
i'm
i'm
ever
going
to
face
where
there's
supposed
to
be
seventy
five
thousand
or
eighty
thousand
people
there
and
i'm
headlining
that
night
it's
a
friday
night
so
i'm
the
last
act
in
the
show
and
all
of
this
is
okay
this
is
fine
um
i
pack
my
stuff
i
go
downstairs
to
the
um
to
the
front
desk
and
there's
some
kind
of
altercation
at
the
desk
and
i
see
my
bass
player
mikey
and
he's
looking
really
unhappy
he's
looking
really
pale
and
he's
like
half
puerto
rican
half
italian
so
pale
is
not
his
usual
color
so
i
am
concerned
about
this
and
then
i
also
see
my
uh
tour
manager
also
looking
really
upset
and
there's
all
this
buzzing
going
on
and
i'm
like
what's
going
on
so
uh
we
all
knew
that
there
had
been
some
girl
that
had
a
crush
on
mike
you
know
and
this
happens
from
time
to
time
you
know
girls
fall
in
love
with
the
guys
in
the
band
and
i
just
try
and
stay
out
of
it
um
you
know
and
they'd
send
things
or
whatever
and
i
try
and
lay
down
rules
you
know
we
don't
want
random
girls
on
the
bus
but
you
can
have
your
girlfriend
or
you
can
have
your
wife
random
girls
off
the
bus
but
i
kind
of
knew
about
this
random
girl
because
she
um
it
started
off
with
little
gifts
that
were
coming
back
stage
for
mike
and
we
all
thought
that
was
really
cute
and
then
after
that
uh
it
graduated
to
pictures
of
herself
naked
and
well
whatever
um
so
but
then
we
all
became
worried
because
she
had
actually
moved
to
queens
from
london
to
be
near
him
when
we
were
not
on
tour
and
we
all
felt
that
that
was
going
too
far
um
so
now
it
turned
out
that
now
we're
back
in
the
uk
and
we
are
going
to
play
glastonbury
and
she
has
called
him
uh
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
made
these
threats
and
said
to
him
that
she
uh
she
and
her
friend
who's
a
male
guy
who
was
also
calling
the
hotel
uh
were
going
to
shoot
him
if
he
went
out
on
stage
that
night
so
i'm
like
oh
god
i
hate
i
hate
the
i
hate
that
kind
of
day
uh
so
cause
i
just
want
to
be
in
england
where
it's
just
nice
you
know
and
it
was
comfortable
and
it
was
um
you
know
and
and
glastonbury
is
a
festival
of
of
hippies
basically
they
have
a
big
peace
sign
on
the
stage
so
uh
and
i'm
thinking
is
this
really
gonna
happen
but
my
manager
feels
that
we
should
take
it
seriously
so
he
calls
scotland
yard
so
we
were
all
waiting
for
mr
scotland
yard
to
show
up
the
uh
detective
shows
up
and
he
takes
the
trip
with
us
on
the
bus
mike
is
freaking
out
everybody's
freaking
out
so
uh
and
i'm
like
okay
um
so
he
asks
us
some
questions
he
finds
out
some
things
about
this
girl
he
finds
out
some
things
about
the
other
man
who
was
making
the
the
calls
and
this
kind
of
thing
so
the
tension
is
kind
of
building
it's
a
long
trip
and
we
finally
get
there
and
we
wind
our
way
through
this
crowd
of
people
and
we're
trying
to
find
our
way
back
stage
to
where
the
bus
is
supposed
to
be
and
it's
kind
of
muddy
i
think
it
had
rained
and
then
it
had
stopped
raining
so
now
there's
all
this
dust
and
stuff
in
the
air
and
there's
throngs
of
people
and
we're
trying
to
find
our
way
back
stage
and
once
we
get
there
i
feel
that
i
that
i
need
to
go
for
a
walk
i
need
a
little
privacy
and
i
try
and
and
go
for
a
walk
i
figure
i'll
go
check
out
some
of
the
booths
that
are
selling
tie
dyed
things
and
military
surplus
uh
mr
scotland
yard
wants
to
walk
with
me
and
i'm
like
no
no
it's
okay
you
know
you
stay
with
mike
i'll
be
fine
no
ms
vega
i
feel
i
really
should
come
with
you
no
i
don't
want
you
to
come
with
me
you
can
stay
with
mike
i
need
to
go
off
and
he
said
no
so
i
said
okay
fine
i'll
stay
here
um
then
we
were
gonna
on
stage
at
about
eleven
o'clock
uh
at
about
nine
thirty
suddenly
four
or
five
policemen
show
up
and
they
come
onto
the
bus
and
they
want
to
have
a
little
chat
with
me
and
i'm
like
why
you
know
mike
will
be
fine
he's
gonna
perform
on
the
side
of
the
stage
we
have
two
bodyguards
for
mike
he's
gonna
perform
in
a
bullet
proof
vest
he's
got
the
two
body
guards
are
there
one
looks
like
mr
clean
and
one
looks
like
gi
joe
and
they're
very
handsome
guys
and
they
are
gonna
defend
mike
so
i'm
like
great
what's
the
problem
so
the
policemen
sit
me
down
and
they
said
well
we
we
didn't
want
to
tell
you
this
because
we
were
we
didn't
want
to
upset
you
but
your
life
was
also
threatened
they
also
said
ms
vega
if
you
go
out
on
stage
you
will
also
get
it
so
being
that
we
have
tracked
down
the
woman
but
we
haven't
tracked
down
her
accomplice
we
feel
that
we
need
to
inform
you
legally
that
you
should
not
do
the
show
tonight
we
that
you
should
not
perform
on
stage
tonight
so
i'm
like
what
are
you
kidding
i'm
like
this
is
friday
night
i'm
headlining
the
glastonbury
festival
there's
like
a
hundred
thousand
people
uh
what
do
you
mean
i'm
not
gonna
do
the
show
of
course
i'm
going
to
do
the
show
you
know
the
show
must
go
on
what
are
you
talking
about
i'm
no
one's
gonna
like
shoot
me
on
the
glastonbury
stage
under
the
peace
sign
um
so
and
then
i'm
thinking
well
anyway
you
don't
want
to
know
what
i
was
thinking
so
um
and
so
i
said
no
no
i
said
i
really
have
to
do
the
show
i
feel
that
i
really
must
and
my
my
keyboard
player
who's
also
my
boyfriend
is
looking
at
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
he's
like
no
no
i
i
don't
think
you
should
do
it
and
i'm
like
i'm
sorry
we
have
to
do
it
how
can
we
possibly
come
back
to
england
if
we
don't
do
the
show
you
know
any
crazy
person
can
call
up
on
the
phone
and
say
that
you
know
whatever
they're
going
to
say
and
then
and
we
they
everybody
would
know
that
we
cancelled
um
so
they
said
okay
well
you'll
have
to
wear
the
bulletproof
vest
as
well
so
i
said
okay
uh
the
only
one
they
had
was
his
and
this
policeman
was
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
i'm
like
half
that
size
so
they
put
it
on
me
and
it's
enormous
and
they
strap
me
in
and
they
gaffers
tape
it
closed
so
i'm
like
okay
and
i'm
like
can
i
still
play
the
guitar
i
think
so
and
then
i
i
i
have
a
they
put
a
huge
denim
jacket
on
over
that
so
no
one
sees
the
bullet
proof
vest
so
now
i'm
all
decked
out
like
a
turtle
like
this
and
my
arms
are
kind
of
like
this
and
i'm
like
okay
but
you
know
i
felt
really
strongly
that
we
should
we
should
go
on
we
should
risk
our
lives
you
know
this
is
rock
and
roll
this
is
what
this
is
what
we
do
so
um
i
remember
that
moment
when
as
i
was
walking
out
on
the
stage
and
i
see
the
microphone
there
and
i'm
in
my
denim
jacket
and
my
gaffers
tape
and
my
bullet
proof
vest
and
things
start
to
feel
like
i'm
going
underwater
and
as
i'm
heading
for
the
microphone
the
thought
suddenly
occurs
to
me
that
they
could
shoot
me
in
the
head
and
i'm
like
oh
i
wish
i
hadn't
thought
that
right
now
but
i'm
not
thinking
about
that
anymore
i'm
just
heading
for
the
microphone
and
then
i
pick
up
the
guitar
and
i
start
singing
and
the
other
thing
that
happened
was
that
now
this
this
whole
situation
has
escalated
to
the
point
where
there's
twenty
policemen
in
front
of
the
stage
there's
a
hundred
thousand
people
behind
them
there's
people
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
from
the
stage
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
this
is
like
several
villages
or
something
um
not
only
that
but
there's
helicopters
overhead
and
they've
decided
to
train
the
lights
not
on
the
stage
which
they
usually
do
but
from
time
to
time
the
swivel
the
lights
onto
the
audience
to
search
them
to
see
if
they
see
anyone
with
a
weapon
so
i'm
singing
every
song
feels
like
it's
taking
twenty
minutes
long
small
blue
thing
just
seems
to
go
on
forever
and
i'm
looking
and
every
so
often
they
swivel
the
lights
onto
the
audience
and
i'm
like
you
know
and
i
continue
to
play
and
every
so
often
i
turn
around
to
look
at
mike
course
he's
not
there
you
know
mike
is
over
there
with
mr
clean
and
gi
joe
and
there's
the
his
um
amplifier
on
the
floor
so
it's
like
where's
mike
oh
there's
his
amp
so
blah
blah
i'm
playing
it's
all
going
pretty
well
i'm
thinking
wow
this
is
great
uh
that
we're
alive
and
um
suddenly
my
keyboard
player
approaches
me
and
he
says
sing
luka
and
get
off
stage
and
i'm
like
why
and
he
goes
i
can't
tell
you
right
now
but
we
have
to
get
off
stage
by
twelve
thirty
and
i'm
like
okay
uh
and
then
i
start
thinking
well
why
do
they
want
to
get
me
off
stage
did
they
find
some
did
they
find
the
weapon
did
they
find
the
girl
did
they
find
her
accomplice
maybe
i
should
just
get
off
stage
and
not
sing
luka
luka
was
my
big
hit
at
that
point
and
it
was
uh
and
i
decided
no
we're
gonna
stay
we're
gonna
sing
luka
we're
gonna
entertain
everybody
they've
come
to
be
entertained
we
have
to
do
this
so
i
sing
luka
everybody's
cheering
and
i
come
off
stage
and
it
all
feels
like
it's
going
in
slow
motion
and
i
said
what
happened
did
they
find
the
girl
no
did
they
find
her
accomplice
no
did
they
find
somebody
with
a
weapon
no
well
why
did
we
have
to
get
off
stage
at
twelve
thirty
and
then
the
promoter
of
the
festival
comes
over
to
me
and
says
well
ms
vega
we
didn't
get
a
chance
to
explain
this
to
you
before
but
the
festival
has
a
curfew
because
the
farmers
in
the
next
field
have
the
the
cows
and
the
cows
get
disturbed
if
you
sing
past
twelve
thirty
and
it
makes
them
less
productive
and
that's
my
story
and
that's
it

thank
you
