
a
couple
of
weeks
after
i
got
my
phone
call
from
nasa
that
i
was
selected
to
be
an
astronaut
my
information
packet
came
in
the
mail
and
the
cover
letter
had
a
paragraph
at
the
beginning
that
said
congratulations
and
then
there
was
the
second
paragraph
and
it
said
practice
your
swimming
you
will
be
required
to
pass
a
swim
test
in
order
to
go
to
water
survival
training
with
the
united
states
navy
in
pensacola
and
i
could
not
believe
this
because
after
years
of
applications
and
interviews
and
medical
examinations
from
head
to
toe
and
an
extensive
background
check
never
once
did
anyone
ever
think
to
ask
do
you
know
how
to
swim
and
if
they
did
my
answer
would
have
been
not
really
although
i
grew
up
on
long
island
and
was
surrounded
by
water
my
entire
life
i
didn't
like
swimming
and
i
completely
hated
the
water
i
was
a
skinny
little
kid
who
was
always
freezing
when
i
got
wet
and
i
didn't
like
having
my
head
under
the
water
i
couldn't
breathe
i
didn't
like
having
chlorine
in
my
eyes
when
i
would
go
to
a
pool
party
i
would
go
on
my
tippy
toes
just
so
my
head
was
exposed
and
pretend
like
i
was
having
a
good
time
and
now
the
one
thing
that
i
hated
and
avoided
my
entire
life
had
now
become
the
one
thing
that
i
had
to
do
well
and
the
one
thing
that
was
gonna
stand
between
my
me
and
my
dream
of
flying
in
space
i
wasn't
gonna
let
that
stop
me
i
had
the
summer
to
get
ready
i
took
my
kids
to
the
pool
every
day
and
i
swam
and
i
practice
and
i
practice
and
i
practice
and
at
the
end
of
that
summer
i
reported
for
duty
at
the
johnson
space
center
a
much
better
swimmer
but
still
very
very
nervous
about
what
i
was
going
to
have
to
do
there
and
i
reported
there
with
forty
three
other
new
astronauts
but
we
weren't
really
astronauts
yet
we
were
astronaut
candidates
or
as
our
senior
astronauts
called
us
ass
cans
we
were
all
forty
four
new
ass
cans
and
in
our
initial
briefing
they
told
us
how
we
could
grow
up
to
be
astronauts
and
they
gave
us
a
list
of
things
that
we
were
gonna
be
doing
over
the
next
two
years
all
the
different
examinations
and
qualifications
that
we
would
net
to
net
net
have
to
get
in
order
to
do
that
and
the
very
first
test
we
were
gonna
have
was
the
swim
test
and
i
was
like
really
can't
we
have
like
a
math
quiz
or
a
physics
test
and
then
the
briefer
went
on
and
said
okay
all
the
strong
swimmers
in
this
class
raise
your
hand
and
a
couple
of
the
military
people
raise
their
hand
we
had
a
navy
diver
raised
her
hand
and
then
he
asked
okay
all
the
weak
swimmers
raise
your
hands
and
be
honest
and
i
sheepishly
raise
my
hand
along
with
a
couple
other
egghead
phds
you
know
yeah
you
know
and
he
said
great
you
strong
swimmers
and
you
weak
swimmers
this
weekend
you're
gonna
work
together
and
you
strong
swimmers
we
gonna
get
these
weak
swimmers
ready
to
pass
the
test
that's
exactly
what
we
did
and
we
showed
up
that
next
week
all
forty
four
of
us
to
take
this
test
in
full
gear
flight
suit
boots
and
helmet
and
the
feeling
that
day
was
everyone
was
gonna
pass
and
we
were
not
gonna
leave
that
pool
until
everyone
passed
and
we
got
in
the
water
and
we
did
our
long
distance
swim
uh
demonstrating
all
the
survival
strokes
that
we
needed
to
show
we
did
a
lap
underwater
we
demonstrated
that
we
could
save
each
other
do
a
rescue
swim
we
drown
proofed
that
mets
we
we
got
on
our
back
with
only
our
mouth
exposed
bringing
in
uh
sips
of
air
to
fill
our
lungs
so
we
get
buoyancy
on
the
water
and
then
after
you
are
good
and
tired
from
all
that
it
was
time
to
tread
tread
water
and
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
that
tread
they
blew
a
whistle
and
you
had
to
bring
your
hands
out
of
the
water
and
if
your
hands
went
underneath
the
water
you
failed
and
you
had
to
do
the
whole
test
over
again
and
as
i'm
treading
for
dear
life
with
my
hands
out
of
the
water
those
last
few
minutes
i'm
looking
around
at
my
new
classmates
i
look
for
mike
fink
and
don't
see
him
anymore
but
i
see
his
hands
they
didn't
say
anything
about
your
head
being
out
of
the
water
they
only
said
your
hands
had
to
be
out
of
the
water
and
by
golly
mike
was
not
gonna
let
his
hands
go
under
that
water
and
i
realize
just
how
determined
this
group
of
people
was
these
people
that
i
had
now
become
classmates
with
future
astronauts
with
every
one
of
us
passed
everyone
pass
that
test
and
a
few
weeks
later
we
flew
down
to
naval
air
station
pensacola
the
home
of
naval
aviation
and
for
a
kid
who
dreamt
about
being
an
astronaut
and
watched
the
right
stuff
a
thousand
times
and
read
that
book
about
a
hundred
times
i
was
in
heaven
there
were
f
eighteens
with
blue
angels
in
them
screaming
overhead
there
were
young
navy
and
marine
recruits
exercising
and
running
all
over
the
place
and
then
there
was
us
and
we
were
there
to
be
trained
to
eject
out
of
a
high
performance
aircraft
be
able
to
work
our
parachute
and
our
survival
gear
and
survive
in
the
water
long
enough
for
someone
to
come
and
get
us
now
this
is
something
that
i
would
never
dream
of
doing
in
a
million
years
and
i
found
out
how
the
navy
was
gonna
get
us
ready
to
do
this
you
don't
jump
out
of
the
plane
the
first
day
what
you
do
is
you
take
it
step
by
step
and
they
build
you
up
inch
by
inch
baby
steps
until
you're
ready
to
do
the
big
exercise
at
the
end
of
the
week
so
what
we
started
to
do
was
get
by
the
end
of
the
pool
just
on
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
jump
in
and
then
once
you
got
that
down
you'd
went
on
a
platform
about
a
foot
off
the
water
and
you
jump
from
there
and
you
got
progressively
higher
and
then
they
told
us
how
to
go
through
our
checklist
once
we
get
ejected
from
the
aircraft
make
sure
your
canopy
was
good
you
needed
a
good
canopy
above
your
head
and
if
you
didn't
have
one
they
told
you
what
to
do
to
fix
it
and
then
you
went
through
all
your
other
checks
make
sure
your
mask
is
off
your
visor
is
up
deploy
your
sea
kit
with
all
your
survival
gear
and
then
make
sure
most
important
one
most
important
things
for
me
anyway
was
that
your
lpu
your
life
preserver
unit
was
inflated
cuz
that's
what's
gonna
keep
you
floating
when
you
hit
the
water
and
then
pull
three
lines
a
three
line
jettison
which
allows
you
to
steer
the
parachute
and
after
you
got
into
the
water
they
told
us
how
to
get
away
from
the
parachute
and
how
to
release
from
it
because
that
could
fill
with
water
and
take
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
we
did
this
step
by
step
and
the
graduation
exercise
came
at
the
end
of
that
week
what
that
was
was
gonna
be
a
parasail
above
the
gulf
where
we
were
going
to
release
from
the
boat
enter
the
water
got
to
get
out
get
into
a
raft
signal
for
help
and
they
would
come
pick
us
up
and
we
had
to
do
that
twice
and
if
you
did
that
twice
successfully
you
pass
the
water
survival
course
that
friday
came
and
i'm
out
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
a
platform
ship
getting
ready
to
be
hooked
up
to
a
cable
they
ka
be
taken
parasailing
for
this
final
exam
and
my
classmate
right
in
front
of
me
is
stephanie
wilson
stephanie
wilson
is
about
five
foot
two
and
weighs
about
a
hundred
pounds
stephanie
wilson
is
about
the
size
of
one
of
my
legs
stephanie
starts
marching
in
place
she
gets
a
little
tug
from
the
boat
takes
about
a
step
and
off
she
goes
like
peter
pan
kay
then
he
hook
me
up
to
the
boat
to
the
to
the
line
and
i'm
really
really
nervous
because
not
only
am
i
scared
of
the
water
i
am
also
afraid
of
heights
yeah
i
know
let
it
out
an
astronaut
an
astronaut
who's
afraid
of
heights
i
start
marching
in
place
just
like
they
told
me
and
then
i
start
walking
and
i'm
getting
pulled
and
then
i
start
walking
faster
and
i
start
running
and
then
i
start
thinking
this
boat
is
not
infinitely
long
i
get
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
i'm
still
removing
my
legs
i
haven't
gotten
airborne
yet
and
i
start
going
toward
the
ocean
and
i
plunge
and
belly
flop
about
twenty
feet
and
do
a
face
plant
into
the
water
and
then
the
boat
starts
dragging
me
through
the
water
and
as
i'm
trying
to
gasp
for
air
and
look
i
see
this
chief
petty
officer
our
instructor
in
the
back
of
that
boat
signaling
to
me
telling
me
release
from
your
chute
release
from
your
chute
i
release
from
the
chute
just
like
she
told
me
then
they
come
and
get
me
and
my
lpu
the
thing
that's
supposed
to
save
me
the
life
preserver
unit
had
popped
on
impact
they
had
a
navy
doctor
check
me
out
and
he
turns
to
the
chief
petty
officer
and
says
he'll
be
okay
and
she
looks
to
me
and
says
that's
good
you
still
gotta
do
it
twice
that
didn't
count
i
get
hooked
up
to
the
boat
again
i
start
marching
i
start
running
i
hit
the
edge
of
the
boat
again
and
here
comes
round
two
with
the
water
but
this
time
i
skim
the
water
with
my
feet
my
sail
inflates
and
i
rise
above
the
water
and
then
i
get
a
signal
from
the
chief
petty
officer
the
green
flags
waving
at
me
and
that
means
to
release
from
the
boat
and
i
do
that
and
then
i
go
through
my
checklist
canopy
visor
mask
sea
kit
lpu
three
line
jettison
and
i
steer
myself
down
and
i
keep
my
eye
on
a
horizon
horizon
horizon
let
it
come
wait
for
it
wait
for
it
i
see
the
horizon
coming
up
my
feet
get
a
little
bit
wet
i
release
from
my
chute
i
do
my
survival
exercise
they
come
get
me
and
i
have
to
do
it
one
more
time
and
i
can
pass
they
hook
me
up
again
i
march
walk
run
drop
don't
get
wet
come
up
high
and
i
pause
for
a
moment
and
i
looked
around
it
was
a
beautiful
day
above
the
gulf
that
day
i
could
see
the
coast
of
florida
i
could
see
the
atlantic
ocean
and
it
hit
me
what
i
was
doing
what
an
extraordinary
experience
this
had
been
the
skinny
kid
from
long
island
was
going
through
water
survival
training
as
an
astronaut
candidate
soon
to
be
astronaut
hopefully
with
the
united
states
navy
and
i
looked
down
at
the
boat
and
frantically
the
chief
petty
officer's
waving
the
flag
i
release
do
the
whole
routine
again
land
in
the
water
and
they
come
get
me
and
i
had
this
great
feeling
of
accomplishment
more
than
i
ever
had
in
my
life
i
mean
i
had
gone
through
some
tough
tests
as
a
undergraduate
at
columbia
it
almost
killed
me
to
get
through
my
qualifying
exam
for
my
phd
at
mit
and
to
complete
my
dissertation
but
those
things
for
some
reason
seem
doable
this
was
facing
one
of
the
greatest
fears
i
had
and
i
had
to
do
this
in
order
to
achieve
my
dream
of
flying
in
space
and
i
just
felt
like
a
superhero
getting
this
done
and
then
i
realized
i
had
become
a
good
swimmer
over
those
months
of
practicing
and
going
through
the
swim
test
and
all
these
lessons
and
the
navy
i
had
become
a
really
good
swimmer
i
had
swim
goggles
i
had
a
bathing
suit
i
could
maybe
do
this
for
exercise
for
the
rest
of
my
life
since
that
day
over
the
gulf
of
mexico
twenty
years
ago
i
have
never
swim
another
lap
