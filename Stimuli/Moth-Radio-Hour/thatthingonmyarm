
people
often
ask
me
how
i
got
the
scar
on
my
arm
and
what
happened
was
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
i
got
really
sick
um
and
no
one
could
figure
out
what
was
wrong
with
me
i
was
very
ill
and
finally
after
a
week
of
not
getting
better
my
mother
took
me
to
the
hospital
and
i
after
many
tests
was
finally
days
and
days
later
diagnosed
um
with
a
hyper
allergy
something
called
stevens
johnson
syndrome
and
um
once
they
finally
found
out
what
was
wrong
with
me
they
treated
me
for
it
but
not
before
i
had
spent
uh
weeks
in
the
hospital
weeks
blind
and
mute
as
well
um
as
being
fed
by
tubes
and
having
to
sleep
sitting
up
so
that
i
wouldn't
choke
on
my
own
saliva
my
mother
in
her
fashion
moved
into
the
hospital
to
be
by
my
bedside
and
slept
every
night
in
the
hospital
to
take
care
of
me
and
she
wouldn't
leave
my
side
and
finally
when
i
was
released
on
february
first
i
remember
it
was
a
friday
um
as
we
were
riding
home
in
our
car
she
said
i've
made
a
promise
to
god
that
um
if
god
delivers
you
safely
out
of
the
hospital
that
i
would
go
and
i
would
do
a
penance
and
i
would
go
to
the
temple
and
make
an
offering
to
give
thanks
for
delivering
my
child
home
safely
so
i
know
you're
really
sick
but
i'm
gonna
see
if
your
stepdad
can
can
drive
us
on
sunday
to
the
temple
um
and
i
just
sort
of
nodded
in
my
very
ill
way
and
i
said
okay
and
on
that
sunday
february
third
my
step
father
and
my
mother
and
i
drove
in
our
red
ford
mercury
car
with
the
black
interior
um
to
the
hindu
temple
and
i
was
very
ill
i
was
very
very
weak
and
frail
and
um
that
was
long
enough
ago
i
was
fourteen
a
long
time
ago
when
they
still
had
the
front
seat
that
was
a
couch
seat
so
my
mother
wedged
me
in
between
um
her
and
my
stepdad
because
you
know
she
wanted
to
take
care
of
me
i
was
still
really
sick
i
could
barely
hold
my
head
up
i
i
had
lost
a
lot
of
weight
i
was
so
weak
that
she
said
you
stay
in
the
car
i'll
do
the
offering
she
she
went
she
did
the
prayers
she
did
the
flowers
she
rang
the
bell
she
got
the
food
and
they
came
back
in
the
car
and
she
handed
me
the
squeaky
round
styrofoam
plate
with
bunch
of
yellow
rice
on
it
and
some
vegetable
curry
or
whatever
it
was
and
off
we
went
back
down
the
highway
and
i
remember
thinking
what
a
beautiful
sunny
sunday
it
was
and
i
was
trying
desperately
to
concentrate
on
this
plate
of
food
and
my
mother
said
you
know
just
try
and
have
a
couple
bites
of
it
just
you
know
it's
it's
blessed
it's
from
the
the
puja
we
did
and
as
i
was
eating
this
rice
um
suddenly
i
heard
a
loud
bang
and
i
looked
up
and
i
can
remember
the
plate
flying
and
yellow
rice
everywhere
like
confetti
and
as
the
rice
came
down
all
i
could
see
was
this
beautiful
blue
sky
this
crystal
clear
blue
sky
no
clouds
no
cars
no
road
in
front
of
us
no
trees
no
nothing
just
endless
miraculous
blue
sky
and
these
kind
of
yellow
grains
flying
all
around
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
another
thud
and
then
i
kind
of
heard
and
it
was
us
we
were
flying
and
then
we
were
airborne
i
realized
and
then
what
stopped
our
fall
was
this
tree
and
then
we
kind
of
went
down
further
down
this
embankment
and
then
finally
came
to
a
last
thud
and
it
was
just
stillness
i
kind
of
strain
my
neck
and
i
could
see
my
mother
to
my
right
and
we
were
all
pinned
very
closely
together
and
my
mother
had
her
eyes
closed
and
her
mouth
open
and
blood
was
trickling
out
of
the
side
of
her
mouth
and
to
my
left
my
stepfather
was
saying
over
and
over
again
this
mantra
of
where
are
we
vijay
what
happened
vijay
weren't
we
driving
vijay
we
were
at
the
temple
vijay
vijay
vijay
my
mother
and
from
my
mother
emanated
this
profound
and
nauseating
silence
and
i
started
to
scream
at
my
mother
i
started
to
say
mom
are
you
awake
are
you
awake
if
you're
awake
say
something
say
something
please
if
you're
not
awake
i
love
you
mommy
i
love
you
if
you
are
awake
i
love
you
but
please
say
something
and
in
the
back
of
me
screaming
was
this
chorus
this
nonstop
loop
of
my
stepfather
almost
like
that
cliche
um
image
uh
or
track
that
the
you
know
the
cartoons
when
a
bird
or
a
cartoon
character
is
hit
on
the
head
and
they
say
where
am
i
what
you
know
what's
going
on
and
that
was
exactly
what
he
was
doing
and
he
just
kept
repeating
this
and
it
was
all
of
a
sudden
i
started
feeling
things
i
started
feeling
hot
and
cold
and
wet
and
sticky
and
itchy
and
burning
and
all
i
could
feel
from
my
mother
was
this
silence
emanating
from
her
that
kept
getting
louder
and
louder
the
silence
then
i
finally
heard
a
man
call
down
to
us
and
say
are
you
okay
are
you
okay
i
said
yes
we're
alive
we're
alive
please
get
help
please
please
get
help
and
then
a
bunch
of
firemen
came
and
i
remember
hearing
the
crunch
of
their
boots
down
the
leaves
down
the
you
know
on
the
leaves
down
the
embankment
and
they
came
and
you
know
they
kind
of
got
i
heard
chainsaws
i
heard
a
helicopter
in
the
distance
approaching
um
i
heard
blowtorches
i
would
later
learn
that
they
had
to
use
these
famous
things
called
the
jaws
of
life
to
cut
open
the
roof
of
this
red
ford
mercury
zephyr
and
um
so
you
know
i
got
taken
to
the
city
of
angels
and
um
my
parents
got
taken
somewhere
else
my
arm
you
know
because
we
were
pinned
so
tight
my
arm
had
flown
across
my
mother's
chest
um
and
so
my
arm
was
just
shattered
in
uh
many
pieces
and
i
lay
there
for
hours
and
hours
not
knowing
what
happened
to
my
parents
not
knowing
if
my
parents
were
okay
if
my
mother
was
alive
and
i
remember
being
incredibly
uncomfortable
in
a
cold
hospital
bed
with
glass
everywhere
in
every
crevice
of
my
body
under
my
nails
in
my
hair
in
my
ears
just
shattered
glass
everywhere
and
i
remember
you
know
in
the
emergency
room
i
remember
vague
bits
and
pieces
of
what
people
said
like
you
know
well
i
don't
think
it's
worth
doing
but
you
know
i
question
the
mobility
of
that
arm
or
well
as
the
owner
and
we
were
home
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
heal
my
stepfather
broke
his
uh
leg
his
left
leg
in
four
places
his
hip
in
two
my
mother
had
to
come
home
and
still
have
a
hospital
bed
at
home
for
weeks
and
months
um
and
we
had
one
to
one
nursing
twenty
four
hours
around
the
clock
at
home
because
of
course
my
mother
this
time
could
not
care
for
me
could
not
be
by
my
side
indeed
she
had
her
own
hospital
bed
but
my
mother
was
determined
they
said
that
they
weren't
gonna
do
any
surgery
on
my
arm
because
they
thought
it
wasn't
really
worth
it
that
it
would
probably
be
dormant
be
kind
of
semi
lame
at
my
side
and
you
know
i
was
so
young
i
could
learn
to
do
everything
with
my
left
hand
and
so
my
mother
was
determined
not
to
let
this
happen
and
so
she
from
her
hospital
bed
at
home
ordered
me
to
go
to
another
orthopedist
whom
she
had
found
on
the
phone
through
colleagues
and
he
said
well
she's
so
young
we
should
do
it
and
he
decided
to
do
surgery
on
my
arm
and
and
i
got
this
very
beautiful
thin
scratch
of
a
surgery
incision
and
there
was
a
cylindrical
metal
plate
that
was
put
on
and
as
my
arm
got
better
the
scar
got
worse
and
you
know
i
was
very
awkward
to
begin
with
and
i
was
feeling
you
know
i
was
fourteen
had
all
these
hormones
and
feeling
off
about
my
body
and
i
knew
that
the
scar
on
my
forearm
was
looking
bad
and
so
i
knew
what
was
to
come
with
this
scar
and
so
anyway
years
go
by
and
i
had
to
have
multiple
surgeries
on
the
arm
every
time
the
arm
got
more
and
more
better
and
every
time
the
scar
got
longer
and
thicker
and
ropier
and
darker
and
you
know
i
kind
of
found
ways
to
look
normal
while
hiding
it
you
know
and
um
i
would
go
on
dates
in
college
and
i
would
have
to
really
think
about
whether
i
was
gonna
wear
a
short
sleeve
blouse
or
a
long
sleeve
blouse
and
um
then
i
was
studying
abroad
and
and
i
started
modeling
of
all
things
and
you
know
i
wasn't
a
fancy
model
i
i
used
it
i
graduated
from
college
and
then
i
really
started
modeling
to
pay
off
my
college
loans
was
a
fit
model
a
work
a
day
model
um
and
then
this
weird
thing
happened
and
the
agency
called
me
and
they
said
guess
what
helmut
newton
wants
to
shoot
you
and
you
know
i
was
uh
young
and
i
i
was
like
who's
helmut
newton
they
said
you
know
helmut
newton
the
guy
he's
great
he
does
these
beautiful
sexy
dangerous
edgy
pictures
of
women
and
he
wants
to
shoot
you
so
you
know
before
my
agency
would
you
know
when
they're
calling
around
so
they'd
get
comments
like
you
know
she's
yeah
she's
kind
of
pretty
but
that
scar
those
same
people
were
calling
going
can
we
book
the
girl
with
the
scar
it's
amazing
that
somebody
else
thinking
you're
cool
can
make
you
think
differently
of
yourself
and
you
know
so
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
doing
all
these
runway
shows
you
know
it
was
like
doing
alberta
ferretti
and
her
village
and
all
these
gray
and
so
my
salary
got
went
up
and
you
know
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
the
girl
with
the
scar
so
you
know
maybe
this
scar
was
this
mixed
blessing
in
a
way
right
cuz
it
paid
off
my
college
loans
and
you
know
bought
me
an
apartment
paid
off
my
mom's
mortgage
a
lot
of
cool
things
so
i
thought
that
was
great
and
i
was
thinking
about
all
of
this
recently
because
i
found
myself
um
on
my
back
in
another
hospital
bed
staring
at
another
white
ceiling
and
i
was
told
that
i
would
probably
never
have
children
naturally
and
that
was
very
upsetting
as
many
women
can
understand
and
men
too
and
then
i
got
pregnant
which
was
a
real
surprise
but
a
happy
one
um
and
then
i
was
told
it
would
be
a
difficult
pregnancy
and
then
it
was
a
really
difficult
pregnancy
and
i
was
ordered
on
complete
bed
rest
the
last
trimester
of
my
pregnancy
and
my
mother
in
true
fashion
moved
in
with
me
the
next
day
yeah
it's
true
and
you
know
your
mother
moves
in
with
you
at
thirty
nine
it's
a
completely
different
experience
but
there
she
was
valiant
in
her
nurturing
and
um
you
know
it
it
was
a
very
scary
uh
last
few
weeks
of
the
pregnancy
i
wind
up
going
to
the
hospital
more
than
once
before
i
had
the
baby
and
one
time
for
five
days
with
a
fetal
heart
monitor
and
tubes
everywhere
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
thinking
to
myself
god
please
get
me
out
of
here
