
my
mom
was
a
really
amazing
person
uh
she
was
the
type
of
person
that
could
take
any
mundane
life
event
and
turn
it
into
a
party
in
about
ten
minutes
flat
uh
she
was
really
really
into
holidays
um
and
she
could
take
our
normal
suburban
pittsburgh
house
and
turn
it
into
all
these
magical
worlds
uh
and
not
just
for
holidays
that
like
everybody
decorates
for
we
had
a
special
set
of
flags
that
were
just
for
memorial
day
that
were
different
than
the
flags
that
we
used
on
the
fourth
of
july
christmas
was
a
really
big
deal
uh
we
had
a
tree
in
every
room
and
every
tree
had
a
theme
she
liked
themes
i
never
had
a
birthday
party
that
didn't
have
one
uh
there
was
the
victorian
tea
party
and
the
fitness
birthday
party
i'm
an
only
child
what
can
i
say
uh
i
think
she
just
really
wanted
everything
to
be
special
but
growing
up
like
this
that
also
meant
that
our
house
had
a
lot
of
stuff
in
it
if
we're
being
honest
she
was
a
packrat
verging
onto
a
hoarder
uh
she
had
all
the
tendencies
if
she
saw
something
she
liked
she
bought
three
of
them
she
had
all
of
these
materials
for
projects
that
she
never
even
started
let
alone
finished
she
saved
everything
like
normal
stuff
that
parents
save
like
schoolwork
but
then
like
old
bits
of
wrapping
paper
and
ribbons
she
never
threw
away
a
piece
of
clothes
um
she
had
two
closets
and
two
armoirs
just
full
of
her
clothing
and
that
was
kind
of
her
mo
like
if
you
walkd
into
our
house
you
would
never
know
that
she
had
all
of
this
stuff
because
it
was
all
tucked
away
into
closets
and
drawers
nooks
crannies
uh
the
attic
was
so
full
that
we
weren't
even
allowed
to
go
in
it
and
it
was
all
christmas
decorations
so
i
as
much
as
i
loved
this
celebration
like
i
could
just
never
wrap
my
brain
around
the
amount
of
stuff
like
even
as
a
child
i
just
didn't
understand
the
point
of
having
things
that
we
only
use
once
a
year
or
that
she
would
just
buy
and
forget
about
so
now
i'm
someone
who
complulsively
cleans
uh
when
i
open
my
own
closet
and
i
see
something
that
i
haven't
you
know
looked
at
or
thought
about
for
a
couple
months
it
like
immediately
goes
to
goodwill
i'm
not
super
sentimental
with
things
um
you
know
my
husband
might
get
me
a
card
and
write
a
little
note
in
it
and
i'll
put
it
out
and
then
find
a
way
to
like
quietly
get
rid
of
it
um
so
growing
up
in
this
house
i
just
you
know
i
could
never
understand
all
this
stuff
um
i
was
just
more
pragmatic
than
she
ever
was
she
was
also
really
sick
uh
for
my
entire
life
uh
we
had
a
lot
of
holidays
in
hospitals
or
when
she
was
bedridden
but
that
never
really
slowed
her
down
you
know
she
always
like
dragged
herself
out
of
bed
got
the
stuff
up
and
when
she
passed
away
when
i
was
twenty
five
it
was
sudden
but
it
wasn't
necessarily
unexpected
so
while
you
know
my
dad
and
i
weren't
really
prepared
for
it
emotionally
we
had
had
a
chance
to
sort
of
deal
with
that
mentally
so
that
first
christmas
after
she
passed
away
we
decided
we're
gonna
do
the
thing
you
know
we
tracked
down
the
decorations
we
found
as
many
of
them
as
we
could
we
put
them
all
up
and
we
had
a
whole
family
over
and
i
i
cooked
my
first
turkey
all
by
myself
and
even
though
she
wasn't
there
and
it
wasn't
quite
the
same
it
felt
okay
you
know
this
is
the
new
normal
we
can
figure
this
out
and
about
a
year
after
that
i
got
the
phone
call
from
my
dad
i'm
gonna
sell
the
house
you
know
it's
too
big
and
i
took
this
a
lot
harder
than
your
average
adult
does
it
was
the
only
house
that
i
had
ever
lived
in
my
entire
life
from
when
i
was
born
until
i
went
away
to
college
i
just
couldn't
imagine
a
world
in
where
i
wasn't
going
back
to
that
house
but
despite
my
hesitations
this
is
what's
happening
so
i
go
home
to
help
him
clean
out
the
house
and
immediately
it
is
just
stuff
overwhelm
i
mean
there
is
twenty
years
worth
of
stuff
here
that
nobody
has
ever
really
gone
through
and
i
live
in
brooklyn
in
an
apartment
what
am
i
gonna
do
with
a
formal
dining
room
table
and
like
eight
chairs
that
are
so
heavy
i
can
barely
lift
them
let
alone
an
entire
attic
full
of
christmas
decorations
and
it
immediately
just
made
me
feel
like
a
pretty
terrible
daughter
because
i
knew
the
expectation
was
that
i
was
supposed
to
keep
all
of
this
stuff
that
somehow
one
day
i
was
gonna
have
my
own
house
and
i
was
gonna
fill
it
up
with
the
stuff
and
our
lives
were
just
really
different
that
was
never
gonna
be
my
thing
so
i'm
standing
there
having
this
moment
in
the
house
looking
at
this
dining
room
table
and
my
dad
says
to
me
you
gotta
go
clean
out
the
closet
in
the
bedroom
in
my
house
for
my
entire
life
this
specific
closet
was
always
called
the
closet
that
eats
everything
and
it
was
called
this
because
if
you
lost
something
in
my
house
no
matter
where
this
item
originated
from
it
wound
up
in
this
closet
like
that
room
in
harry
potter
where
all
the
missing
stuff
goes
uh
it
was
like
a
series
of
pneumatic
tubes
like
would
connect
to
the
garage
and
the
kitchen
and
no
matter
where
this
item
originated
it
wound
up
in
this
closet
i'd
be
like
lose
a
shirt
and
i'd
be
like
mom
have
you
seen
my
shirt
oh
well
did
you
check
the
closet
that
eats
everything
no
mom
why
would
it
be
in
there
and
she's
like
open
the
door
and
pull
out
the
shirt
is
this
the
one
you're
looking
for
just
happened
more
times
than
i
could
count
but
the
real
reason
that
i
was
anxious
about
going
into
this
closet
was
because
it
was
also
where
we
kept
all
of
the
family
photos
and
the
scrapbooking
materials
so
i
made
a
plan
i
was
not
going
to
engage
with
any
of
the
stuff
i
was
just
going
to
sort
the
stuff
because
nostalgia
is
the
enemy
of
all
successful
cleaning
expeditions
so
family
photos
keep
one
pile
uh
old
unsent
greeting
cards
throw
away
another
pile
and
that
lasted
for
about
five
minutes
before
i'm
knee
deep
in
the
family
photos
going
through
every
single
one
of
them
and
i'm
looking
at
pictures
of
us
you
know
around
that
ugly
table
thanksgiving
and
a
bunch
of
s
you
know
six
year
old
girls
in
puffy
dresses
having
a
tea
party
and
photos
of
christmas
trees
that
were
so
beautiful
that
they
could
have
been
in
magazines
and
all
that
stuff
started
to
get
really
real
again
and
that
is
when
i
noticed
this
box
it's
just
a
normal
cardboard
box
it
looked
kind
of
new
so
my
first
thought
was
like
oh
my
god
here's
another
thing
that
she
bought
that
she
didn't
even
know
that
she
had
but
i
picked
it
up
and
the
contents
inside
were
like
shifting
a
little
bit
and
it
was
heavy
so
i
opened
it
and
i
look
down
and
it
is
a
box
of
greeting
cards
okay
so
she
got
the
guy
at
hallmark
to
give
her
the
overstock
for
some
reason
you
know
but
then
i
noticed
them
and
none
of
them
have
any
envelopes
i
thought
that
was
weird
so
i
picked
up
the
first
card
and
it
was
a
first
birthday
card
it
was
my
first
birthday
card
it
said
to
morgan
on
it
and
when
you
opened
it
up
it
had
slots
inside
of
it
where
you're
supposed
to
put
pennies
from
the
year
that
the
baby
is
born
and
all
of
the
nineteen
eighty
three
pennies
were
still
in
there
so
i
keep
digging
though
this
box
and
there's
more
first
birthday
cards
and
there's
cards
from
christmas
and
halloween
because
who
gives
greeting
cards
on
halloween
and
thanksgiving
and
birthdays
and
valentine's
day
and
cards
that
i
have
received
just
because
or
because
we
had
a
fight
and
it
dawns
on
me
and
as
a
parent
that
this
entire
box
is
every
single
greeting
card
that
was
ever
exchanged
between
me
and
my
mom
and
my
dad
from
the
time
that
i
was
born
up
until
the
fairly
recent
past
and
i
just
did
not
undertand
this
box
and
it
made
me
really
angry
and
upset
because
i
there
was
obviously
something
that
i
was
supposed
to
know
about
this
box
something
that
she
knew
she
was
saving
these
things
for
a
reason
but
i
didn't
know
what
it
was
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
here's
this
box
of
memories
that
i
am
confronted
with
this
is
what
i
was
so
worried
about
losing
in
the
house
but
now
they're
my
responsibility
and
before
i
knew
it
my
whole
body
just
started
sort
of
reacting
without
me
and
i
panicked
and
i
started
to
throw
everything
away
just
ripping
things
and
throwing
them
and
i
am
weeping
and
that's
how
my
dad
found
me
was
like
in
a
pile
of
greeting
cards
you
know
surrounded
by
stuff
so
i
tell
him
about
the
box
and
we
start
to
sort
of
calmly
go
through
it
and
he
picks
up
a
card
and
he
looks
at
it
and
he
says
i
remember
getting
this
birthday
card
i
had
it
on
my
desk
for
a
while
and
then
i
threw
it
away
i
specifically
remember
throwing
this
card
away
so
now
we
have
this
moment
where
we're
laughing
together
at
this
image
of
my
mom
like
digging
through
the
trash
to
save
greeting
cards
and
it
just
dawned
on
us
that
we're
never
gonna
know
the
answer
to
this
mystery
that
she's
gone
and
i'm
looking
through
cards
and
i
see
cards
that
i
signed
my
name
to
but
that
i
don't
remember
buying
and
cards
that
have
my
name
on
them
but
that
i
don't
really
remember
getting
and
without
her
without
her
logic
and
her
magic
they
were
just
stuff
they
were
just
her
stuff
the
the
box
the
cards
they
weren't
my
memories
to
save
they
were
her
memories
and
she
had
just
saved
so
much
stuff
that
none
of
it
was
really
special
anymore
you
know
to
me
that
the
most
special
thing
about
this
box
was
that
she
had
cared
enough
to
save
it
in
the
first
place
and
that
i
got
to
experience
that
one
more
time
so
we
each
took
a
few
things
and
ultimately
we
decided
we
could
let
it
go
we
could
get
rid
of
the
rest
of
them
we
took
them
to
the
recycling
bin
and
the
next
day
i
went
back
to
new
york
and
i
never
set
foot
in
that
house
again
but
i
had
this
new
sense
of
calm
about
the
whole
thing
and
uh
in
the
back
seat
with
me
on
my
drive
was
a
box
of
christmas
ornaments
and
a
card
full
of
nineteen
eighty
three
pennies
